        encoding=\"utf-8\" ?><html><body><p>Instead of trying to save money on groceries,
        I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I
        <em>did<\/em> stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.<\/p>\n<p>Soylent
        is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not
        a chef, and it&rsquo;s engineered to give your body everything you need to
        function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone,
        and &mdash; in theory &mdash; should still lead a perfectly normal life.<\/p>\n<p>Changing
        your lifestyle to this extent isn&rsquo;t as abnormal as you may think. In
        the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion,
        according to IBISWorld.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Time Is Money<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The
        Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn&rsquo;t
        about money &mdash; it was about time.<\/p>\n<p>You may think I&rsquo;m being
        stingy with my time, but I&rsquo;m young. Think of all the time I would save
        by not having to cook. That would effectively add months to my life! I also
        wouldn&rsquo;t have to grocery shop very often (never, really). Soylent can
        be delivered to my door.<\/p>\n<p>The second reason I found it so appealing
        was for health reasons. Stay with me, because I&rsquo;m about to get pretty
        holistic about life.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>I love automation. Automation
        means you can set something good in motion and have it run without you.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This
        means you can do awesome things without constant motivation. Think automatic
        bill pay or 401(k) contributions.<\/p>\n<p>Without Soylent, I&rsquo;m constantly
        having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day.
        That means I&rsquo;m having to consciously make healthy choices three-plus
        times per day, so I sometimes don&rsquo;t eat as healthy as I should. With
        Soylent, I can be healthy without having to worry about the ingredients.<\/p>\n<p>Of
        course, I wouldn&rsquo;t replace <em>all<\/em> my meals with Soylent. But
        many of my boring meals would get replaced.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Vacation Meals
        on a Budget<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The final reason Soylent caught my eye is
        the cost. Prices vary based on the amount and whether it&rsquo;s in bottled
        or powder form for you to mix, but it&rsquo;s around $3 per bottle, or $3
        per meal.<\/p>\n<p>Though that&rsquo;s more expensive than most home-cooked
        meals, it saves a lot of money when traveling or just being out and about.
        Instead of needing to buy a meal, you can just pull a bottle out of your backpack
        or purse, and crack it open.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"aff-cta\"><label>Save

        no cooking during the week. We do this and order in once a week. We keep fresh

        Start of a New Diet<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>I ordered my first round of Soylent
        a month ago straight from the website. The package arrived three days later.
        I opened the box and inside were a dozen white plastic bottles with black
        caps.<\/p>\n<p>I waited to try one until the next day &mdash; I wanted to
        start with an empty stomach so I could get the full effect. That morning,
        I tried my first sip. It was oddly delicious. I was surprised.<\/p>\n<p>Soylent
        is designed to have a neutral flavor so that the consumer doesn&rsquo;t get
        sick of the taste. But still, it was slightly sweet. Soylent subtly smells
        and tastes of a graham cracker and looks like a light cappuccino.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>An
        Epic Diet Fail<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>About 20 minutes later, I felt like I had
        the flu. I ate some &ldquo;real&rdquo; food and the flu-like symptoms disappeared.
        I tried more Soylent the next day. Same reaction. I tried two more times &mdash;
        same reaction again.<\/p>\n<p>I drank part of one right before doing 45 minutes
        of a cardio workout to check my energy levels. Exercising with the actual
        flu would&rsquo;ve been easier.<\/p>\n<p>I Googled my symptoms. My reaction
        was very rare. It&rsquo;s most likely the vanillin flavoring was to blame.
        And with that, my Soylent diet journey came to an abrupt end.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Although
        my experience is negative, I still recommend you give it a try.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I
        got my mom, dad, and cousin to drink Soylent, and they all really enjoyed
        it. At least <em>they<\/em> can save time, enjoy better health, and save money.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll
        continue my quest for a meal replacement beverage. So long, Soylent.<\/p>\n<p>Jamie
        Sullivan, director of communication at Soylent, says: &ldquo;We know many
        people use our products to save both time and money and are able to do so
        successfully. However, we <strong>do not recommend <\/strong>anyone switching
        to a Soylent only diet.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Additionally, we always recommend
        everyone connect with their doctor or dietitian to decide the best overall
        meal plan to support your personal health goals and nutrition plan,&rdquo;
        Sullivan adds.<\/p>\n<p>CentSai does not recommend changing your lifestyle
        or dietary habits without consulting your physician.<\/p>\n<p><\/p><\/body><\/html>\n","post_image":null,"post_url":null,"canonical_url":"https:\/\/centsai.com\/save-money\/frugality\/soylent-diet-ups-and-downs\/","post_date":null,"six_second_take":null,"author_id":null,"author_name":null,"author_url":null,"author_image":null,"category_id":null,"category_name":null,"category_link":null,"sponsored_content":null,"sponsored_image":null,"sponsored_url":null,"video_url":"","podcast_url":"","featured_partner":null,"featured_partner_url":null,"featured_part_desc":null,"featured_part_img":null},{"post_id":80398,"post_template":"infographics","post_title":"[INFOGRAPHIC]

        encoding=\"utf-8\" ?><html><body><p>Financial literacy continues to make slow
        strides in gaining attention, while discussions of appropriate methodologies
        in a school setting remain scant. The lack of sufficient attention to methodology
        has hindered progress; many programs lack meaningful evaluation and longitudinal
        studies are few.<\/p>\n<p>This creates a circular problem: It is difficult
        to get support to expand programs when there is a lack of verifiable evidence
        of their effectiveness, which makes it more difficult to move forward and
        gain that evidence.<\/p>\n<p>A saving grace is the vast need for financial
        literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing
        body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial
        illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and
        people are visibly getting left behind.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Financial
        Literacy Mandates<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There continues to be slow progress
        in the number of states requiring some form of personal financial literacy
        education as a high school graduation requirement. It&rsquo;s now about half,
        which is significant, but it is clearly not where we need to be.<\/p>\n<p>Few
        states, however, require students to take a stand-alone course in personal
        finance. More require personal finance education integrated with other coursework.
        Mandates are great, but they don&rsquo;t mean that it actually happens.<\/p>\n<p>It
        is concerning to see young people graduating high school barely able to read
        or write; there can be little confidence that they somehow attained reasonable
        financial literacy education while missing out on reading in schools.<\/p>\n<p>The
        mandates are not always being followed. Schools face many challenges, and
        states aren&rsquo;t going to push very hard on getting those who can&rsquo;t
        read to be good with money. They probably feel they have bigger problems.<\/p>\n<p>State
        financial literacy education mandates in schools are important but not sufficient.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The
        Feedback Challenge<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Financial literacy education should
        make a lifetime of difference. All too often results are either not measured
        or measured at a point in time. And the focus tends to be on knowledge alone.<\/p>\n<p>Knowledge
        is important, but financial literacy is a skill; you need to apply it and
        use it to develop the skill. You learn skills through practicing with knowledge
        &mdash; both knowledge and experience are required.<\/p>\n<p>It is a lot like
        welding &mdash; you can read a bunch of books but that does not make you competent
        with a torch. You need both knowledge and experience to be a good welder,
        as you need both knowledge and experience to be competent at any skill.<\/p>\n<p>Doesn&rsquo;t
        matter if it is baking or flying or financial literacy, knowledge does little
        without experience, and experience can be an expensive and dangerous teacher
        in the absence of knowledge. They are inseparable; neither has meaningful
        value alone.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"aff-cta\"><label>Raising Financially-Smart
        Kids Made Easy<\/label> An App that can be Managed by Parents<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In
        a classroom, there are options to develop the skills of financial literacy,
        just as you would with welding or baking. Financial literacy skills can be
        developed with cases and games, with interactive tools and with competitions.<\/p>\n<p>Hands-on
        training provides the learner with a feedback loop. They take an action and
        a consequence develops. Knowledge training without an experiential component
        is better than nothing, but it cannot compete with experience.<\/p>\n<p>An
        ideal situation is directly hands on. Games are a great substitute, but not
        the only option. Case studies, learning from stories and critiquing the actions
        of others, even simple exercises can add a hands-on component to knowledge
        training and improve the likelihood of long-term improvement.<\/p>\n<p>Knowledge
        has the singular advantage of being easy to test and evaluate. Assessments
        can measure knowledge gains whereas skill development is harder to evaluate.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Program
        Elements<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Effective financial literacy education needs
        to develop several skills. Some are overlooked in knowledge-based programs.<\/p>\n<p>To
        be financially literate, you need to be able to evaluate financial alternatives.
        This can be useful in day-to-day activities like comparison shopping and is
        essential for major purchases.<\/p>\n<p>Financially literate people should
        be able to compare mortgage options and make a reasonable choice based on
        their situation and should be able to evaluate choices like leasing a car
        versus buying a car. Financial decision-making is an essential financial literacy
        skill.<\/p>\n<p>Using technology in finance is important and growing in importance.
        There are fantastic tools available to assist individuals in a myriad of financial
        challenges. But using powerful tools without knowledge of the consequences
        can be a recipe for disaster.<\/p>\n<p>Students need to not only know how
        to use technology &mdash; that&rsquo;s the easy part &mdash; but they also
        need to know when to use technology and what the potential risks are. It is
        too easy to invest in risky investments with technology.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Unfortunately,
        you can experience negative consequences without even knowing the consequences
        were possible.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Technology can be wonderful
        and powerful, or it can be crippling.<\/p>\n<p>Fraud awareness and preventing
        it needs to be an element of a good financial education. It has been bad out
        there, and it is getting worse. People need to know how to protect themselves,
        and where to find out what to watch for as the bad people get better at what
        they do.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Behavioral Finance<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Behavioral
        finance can no longer be ignored. In school, individuals need to learn about
        the behavioral aspects of financial literacy and how to deal with the biggest
        obstacle they will face on their journey to financial success: themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Money
        is an emotional topic. Emotions can cause people to make suboptimal decisions.
        Car dealers know this. You should too.<\/p>\n<p>Students need to learn about
        the risks behavior brings to the table &mdash; and how to combat those risks.
        There must be proactive to solutions to deal with our human tendencies, which
        do not serve us well as long-term accumulators. The more we understand and
        are aware of our own shortcomings the greater our ability to overcome them
        and achieve success.<\/p>\n<p>Markets and volatility are not what holds investors
        back; behaviors in the face of market conditions and volatility are what holds
        investors back. Behavioral finance is an essential component of financial
        literacy.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Systems Thinking<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Financial
        literacy can benefit from systems thinking. Nothing occurs without impacting
        other things. This is as true in financial matters as it is in any other system.<\/p>\n<p>If
        you increase your 401(k) contributions, for example, it impacts not only your
        retirement preparedness, but also your cash flow and your taxes and may impact
        other areas of your financial life. Any single change has the potential for
        multiple consequences.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, financial literacy and financial
        matters occur within larger systems. An individual&rsquo;s numeracy skills
        are a codeterminant of their financial capability. Those with low numeracy
        skills are more likely to struggle financially.<\/p>\n<p>Numeracy education
        is not financial education, but supports financial education. Those challenged
        by numeracy need to gain knowledge of and comfort with other tools to assist
        with numeracy.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Talk It to Death<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>A major
        aim of basic financial literacy programs is to raise awareness while developing
        rudimentary skills.<\/p>\n<p>We can help. We can help in our families and
        we can help in our workplaces. And we can help by simply talking it to death.<\/p>\n<p>We
        can and should talk about financial matters at home. We should talk about
        budgets and we should talk about the process of evaluating financial alternatives.<\/p>\n<p><span
        class=\"aff-cta\"><label>Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy<\/label>
        An App that can be Managed by Parents<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Children who grow up
        in a home where the parents smoke are more likely to smoke; children who grow
        up in homes where the parents demonstrate financial awareness and restraint
        are similarly more likely to pick up these habits.<\/p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t demonstrate
        the habits you don&rsquo;t want the kids to pick up, and repeat the habits
        you would like them to obtain.<\/p>\n<p>Many of us can talk up financial literacy
        at work. We can be advocates for the 401(k) or other retirement plans. We
        can be advocates for debt reduction and we can be advocates for emergency
        funds and we can be advocates for budgets. And we can do that without being
        obnoxious. People don&rsquo;t like to be told what to do, but they do love
        stories.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>If you have a passion for financial
        literacy or financial wellness, you can share that passion.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>You
        may be surprised not only by how many people are interested, but also that
        they will make changes and be excited to tell you of their own progress.<\/p>\n<p>Talk
        it up. Stories are a very powerful teaching tool. Talk it to death.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The
        Bottom Line<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There is no silver bullet for financial illiteracy.
        Amazing things are happening, but we still have a long way to go.<\/p>\n<p>Financial
        literacy is a complex skill and we can spend a lifetime continually learning
        new things. But we won&rsquo;t if we don&rsquo;t have a solid start. Financial
        literacy education needs to build the foundation upon which individuals can
        build the financial lives they wish to have.<\/p>\n<p>We need to keep the
        idea of skill or capability as a guiding principle. Knowledge of the difference
        among investment types is nice but evaluating those differences is essential.
        The skills can be used in changing situations.<\/p>\n<p>There are many tools
        that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help.
        There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day.
        There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy
        the bigger difference we can make.<\/p>\n<p>The forum in which we present
        may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always

        Frugality Is Not Financial Literacy","post_content":"<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC

        encoding=\"utf-8\" ?><html><body><p>Perusing social media might lead you to
        believe that frugality is the essence of financial literacy. Not necessarily.
        Frugal people rarely own airplanes or yachts. The 47 percent of Americans
        who are financially literate and budget-conscious, according to Harris Insights
        and Analytics, very well might.<\/p>\n<p>Frugal people focus on not wasting
        money &mdash; on minimizing their expenses. This can be difficult for low-income
        households to manage thanks to liquidity restraints, according to a report
        in the Journal of Marketing Research.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Though those low-income
        households stand to benefit the most from frugal strategies, such as the ability
        to buy in bulk, they are unfortunately unable to put those strategies into
        effect.<\/p>\n<p>Financially literate people, on the other hand, understand
        the consequences of their financial decisions and act accordingly. They use
        financial resources intentionally. Financially literate people focus on making
        good money decisions. And the best decision often isn&rsquo;t the most frugal
        one.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Living Within Your Means<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The common
        ground between frugality and financial literacy is living within your means.
        But the two approaches are quite different.<\/p>\n<p>In the context of doing
        well financially, living within one&rsquo;s means requires that the sum of
        one&rsquo;s expenses and savings must be at or below one&rsquo;s income. This
        principle transcends both ideologies.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>To be financially
        successful, one has to live within one&rsquo;s means.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><img
        loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-39617 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/centsai.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Frugality-is-Not-Financial-Literacy-1.png\"
        alt=\"Frugality is Not Financial Literacy. Yes, it''s right! Many people seem
        to think that financial literacy means learning to lead a frugal lifestyle.
        But this is far from the truth. #frugality #frugal #financialliteracy\" width=\"267\"
        height=\"400\"><\/p>\n<p>This &ldquo;means equation&rdquo; says that we get
        to spend no more than we make. The frugality camp focuses on minimizing the
        expenses side of the equation. Unfortunately, neglecting the revenue side
        can be a big mistake.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Reducing Expenses vs. Increasing Revenue<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>It
        should be fairly apparent that there&rsquo;s more room to change the revenue
        side of the equation than the expense side &mdash; at least theoretically.
        Changes to the expense side of the equation are limited to the total of the
        expenses &mdash; you can&rsquo;t reduce your expenses beyond zero.<\/p>\n<p>The
        revenue side does not have this barrier. The revenue side is, theoretically,
        infinitely changeable.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"aff-cta\"><label>Get Matched
        With a Financial Adviser Most Suited to Your Unique Needs<\/label> Maximize
        Your Retirement Efforts Today<\/span><\/p>\n<p>There may be a variety of challenges
        when it comes to making dramatic increases in the revenue side of the equation.
        This is especially true in the short term.<\/p>\n<p>Increasing one&rsquo;s
        income can take a lot of time and hard work. It can also require you to make
        an intermediate investment, such as getting training or education.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>Meanwhile,
        frugality &mdash; much like laziness &mdash; pays off immediately.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This
        is frugality&rsquo;s great benefit. Frugality as a tool can help us to navigate
        times of low income, such as a period of unemployment. Frugality can also
        help us to push out additional savings to meet a short-term goal.<\/p>\n<p>But
        eventually, a frugal lifestyle often burns us out. Living &ldquo;without&rdquo;
        robs us of many simple pleasures. It robs us of the emotional peace of enjoying
        simple things because it makes us believe that we&rsquo;re bad for wasting
        money on ourselves.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Frugality vs. Financial Literacy: The
        Bottom Line<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>In the long term, we need to tell frugality
        to pound salt. We need to understand that our self-worth is not equal to the
        number of pennies saved, and we will buy that damn ice cream if we want. Some
        of those little expenses contribute to self-care, which is important for our
        mental and emotional health.<\/p>\n<p>Financial literacy &mdash; making informed
        and intentional financial decisions &mdash; allows us to do what we want,
        if we&rsquo;re willing. If we&rsquo;re willing to understand the ramifications
        of our decisions, then the sky&rsquo;s the limit.<\/p>\n<p>Or the sea&rsquo;s
        the limit, depending on whether you picked the airplane or the yacht. It&rsquo;s
        all about decisions.<\/p>\n<p>In the long run, you can have anything that
        you&rsquo;re willing to earn and build for. Or you can spend less and have
        what&rsquo;s left over. Frugality is a tool. Financial literacy is the whole
        tool set.<\/p>\n<p>The ball is in your court. Choose wisely.<\/p>\n<p><\/p><\/body><\/html>\n","post_image":null,"post_url":null,"canonical_url":"https:\/\/centsai.com\/must-reads\/centsai-sensei\/frugality-not-financial-literacy\/","post_date":null,"six_second_take":null,"author_id":null,"author_name":null,"author_url":null,"author_image":null,"category_id":null,"category_name":null,"category_link":null,"sponsored_content":null,"sponsored_image":null,"sponsored_url":null,"video_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nHFoSrUsEMU","podcast_url":"","featured_partner":null,"featured_partner_url":null,"featured_part_desc":null,"featured_part_img":null},{"post_id":80369,"post_template":"infographics","post_title":"[INFOGRAPHIC]
