        style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, the best business ideas are right in
        front of you. That was the case for Ashley Clark, who pivoted from being a
        banker to an entrepreneur and creator of old-school board games and flashcards
        that teach financial literacy &mdash; going against the current trend of online
        gaming with six-figure success during a pandemic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:
        400;\">A decade as a banker underscored that too many people didn&rsquo;t
        understand their own finances. Clark began to write down common customer questions
        &mdash; using this as her initial &ldquo;market research.&rdquo; Next was
        her tough focus group: her children. Her passion for teaching people about
        money flourished, and today Clark is CEO and founder of <\/span>Sense 2 Cents<span
        style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a financial literacy&ndash;based games company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sense 2 Cents aims to take the chore out of learning
        and foster a solid financial foundation by making the flashcards and board
        games a family activity, in which parents can learn alongside their children.
        Clark has also developed active communities on Instagram and Facebook.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it wasn&rsquo;t all smooth sailing: Three
        months into starting this venture, Clark was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis
        and, being so ill, she understandably wanted to quit. Advice from her entrepreneurial
        mom helped her stay focused, and now she has tips for those starting their
        own business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On this episode
        of SheVentures, discover why financial literacy is so important in establishing
        generational wealth in under-served communities, what financial institutions
        can do to help, and Clark&rsquo;s top tips for success.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><\/body><\/html>\n","post_image":null,"post_url":null,"canonical_url":"https:\/\/centsai.com\/podcast\/sheventures-episode-77-ashley-clark\/","post_date":null,"six_second_take":null,"author_id":null,"author_name":null,"author_url":null,"author_image":null,"category_id":null,"category_name":null,"category_link":null,"sponsored_content":null,"sponsored_image":null,"sponsored_url":null,"video_url":"","podcast_url":"","featured_partner":null,"featured_partner_url":null,"featured_part_desc":null,"featured_part_img":null},{"post_id":80435,"post_template":"column","post_title":"\u201cAccidental\u201d

        encoding=\"utf-8\" ?><html><body><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial
        planning is often pictured in graphic images as an upwardly sloping straight-line
        path that moves seamlessly from Point A to Point B. People set financial goals,
        develop a plan, &ldquo;work the plan&rdquo; by taking action to reach their
        goals, and review and revise the plan every so often or when major lifestyle
        changes occur.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though
        this approach can sometimes work well in normal times, the past year has been
        anything but normal as a result of COVID-19.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:
        400;\">Many personal financial plans (e.g., jobs, education, moving, travel,
        retirement dates) &ldquo;blew up&rdquo; amid layoffs, lockdowns, deaths of
        loved ones, and lives fraught with uncertainty. In addition, legislation and
        the law of supply and demand (i.e., the current U.S. housing market) presented
        opportunities that nobody could have foreseen, much less planned for.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A better graphic image for the financial planning
        process for many people, especially during the past year, is a tangled ball
        of yarn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five examples
        are presented, below, of &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; financial planning opportunities
        that were not on most people&rsquo;s radar screens until recently. They could
        not have been included in personal financial plans previously because they
        were not feasible, not applicable, or did not exist under previous tax laws.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these strategies have arisen in some way,
        shape, or form as a result of the pandemic and may be useful to consider during
        the months ahead:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Deploy Tax Savings From Unemployment
        Tax Leniency<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the <\/span>American
        Rescue Plan Act (ARPA)<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, signed into law
        on March 12, many taxpayers are exempt from income tax on up to $10,200 of
        unemployment benefits that were received during 2020.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Normally, this money would be fully taxable as
        ordinary income (i.e., at a taxpayer&rsquo;s regular marginal tax rate, like
        wages, salaries, and tips) on federal tax returns. This tax break was a last-minute
        addition to the ARPA that few people saw coming and came a month into the
        2020 tax filing season.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Most
        people probably had taxes withheld on their unemployment benefits or sent
        the IRS quarterly estimated payments in expectation of a future tax liability.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result of the ARPA tax law change, those
        individuals could now save $1,000 or more on their income taxes (depending
        on their tax rate and other income sources), resulting in a larger refund
        or a smaller tax bill.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For
        example, $9,000 in unemployment benefits in the 12 percent tax bracket = $1,080
        (9,000 x .12). This is a nice chunk of change to save or repay debt with.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Take
        Tax Credits Available as a Result of Reduced Income<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:
        400;\">Some taxpayers may qualify for income tax breaks in 2020 for which
        they previously earned too much income.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:
        400;\">One example is the Earned Income Tax Credit (<\/span>EITC<span style=\"font-weight:
        400;\">), which maxes out at $15,280 ($21,710) of adjusted gross income (AGI)
        for a single taxpayer and married couple filing jointly with no children and
        $41,756 ($47, 646), $47, 440 ($53,330), and $50,594 ($56,844) with one, two,
        and three or more children, respectively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:
        400;\">The maximum credit amounts on 2020 tax returns for zero, one, two,
        and three or more children are respectively $538, $3,584, $5,920, and $6,660.
        A tax credit is a dollar for dollar reduction in tax liability (e.g., $6,000
        tentative tax bill minus $3,584 EITC = $2,416 final tax bill).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the first time ever, perhaps, taxpayers who
        always earned more than the maximum AGI for the EITC may qualify if they lost
        income as a result of the pandemic. The tax savings could provide funds for
        an emergency fund or debt repayment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Use a Big House
        Profit to Pay Off Accumulated Debt<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:
        400;\">Some homeowners who lost income and got behind on mortgage payments
        are cashing out during the current &ldquo;red hot&rdquo; housing market.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one case that I know of, a home seller who
        owes over $18,000 in arrearages on a federally backed FHA mortgage and has
        no money with which to repay it when the foreclosure moratorium expires on
        June 30 will make about a $60,000 profit as a result of selling the house
        in a bidding war.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After
        paying back the mortgage arrearage and home selling expenses, the seller will
        walk away with about $20,000 after less than two years of homeownership and
        will &ldquo;punt back&rdquo; to apartment living until household finances
        stabilize.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Use a Big House Profit and Downsizing to Build
        a Retirement Nest Egg<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly,
        people who planned to move and downsize anyway and lack sufficient retirement
        savings can benefit from selling their home in the current sellers&rsquo;
        market and moving to something smaller.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:
        400;\">They essentially become cash buyers who are better able to compete
        for new housing in the area where they live or elsewhere. In addition, the
        spread between their old home&rsquo;s price and the cost of a new one provides
        income for future living expenses.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:
        400;\">For example, $300,000 of home sale profit placed in a balanced mutual
        fund with a 6 percent average return will throw off about $18,000 of annual
        income.<\/span><b>&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><b>Increase Savings and Philanthropy<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some Americans have experienced financial silver
        linings that they could have not anticipated as a result of COVID-19: increased
        income due to demand for their industry sector or work skills and\/or reduced
        expenses such as commuting costs, child care, and other expenses.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Like
        home sale profit and income tax breaks, increased cash flow provides an opportunity
        for increased savings, debt reduction, or both.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are also new opportunities for philanthropy.
        On 2020 tax returns, married couples filing jointly or singles who do not
        itemize can deduct $300 in cash contributions to qualified charities.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2021, the tax write-off for couples increases
        to $600. In addition, the 60 percent of AGI cap on donations made by itemizing
        taxpayers is suspended in 2021 to encourage philanthropy for coronavirus relief.<\/span><\/p><\/body><\/html>\n","post_image":null,"post_url":null,"canonical_url":"https:\/\/centsai.com\/must-reads\/money-talk\/pandemic-financial-planning-opportunities\/","post_date":null,"six_second_take":null,"author_id":null,"author_name":null,"author_url":null,"author_image":null,"category_id":null,"category_name":null,"category_link":null,"sponsored_content":null,"sponsored_image":null,"sponsored_url":null,"video_url":"","podcast_url":"","featured_partner":null,"featured_partner_url":null,"featured_part_desc":null,"featured_part_img":null},{"post_id":66548,"post_template":"default","post_title":"Are

        seen the TV shows, listened to the podcasts, and fantasized a bit about living
        in a home in the forest or on a plot of land near a creek.<\/p>\n<p>For those
        saddled with debt, the idea of a tiny home that costs less than $20,000 sounds
        like a great idea. Buying a standard house means spending money on a down
        payment, insurance, interest, and taxes, not to mention maintenance over time.<\/p>\n<p>The
        down payment alone is an extreme obstacle to 62 percent of millennials who
        would not be able to afford a home, according to a survey by Apartment List,
        while an additional 29 percent claim that the monthly payments would be a
        severe financial burden.<\/p>\n<p>This begs the question: Given their low
        cost, are tiny homes good investments?<\/p>\n<p>How much does living the &ldquo;tiny
        life&rdquo; actually cost, and what kind of resale value can you expect from
        owning a tiny house?<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What Are Tiny Homes?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>In
        a few words, the tiny home movement is an effort to combat the prevalence
        of McMansions. It&rsquo;s about reducing the size of the space you live in,
        meaning that many tiny homes are under 500 square feet. They can be made from
        vans, miniature constructions, or even from storage containers that real estate
        entrepreneurs like Janelle Briggs provide.<\/p>\n<p>In the United States,
        there are more than 10,000 tiny homes, according to Go Downsize, and the trend
        seems to be rising.<\/p>\n<p>Tiny-home dwellers may downsize for a variety
        of reasons &mdash; environmental concerns, financial difficulties, or simply
        for flexibility and freedom. Many tiny homes are mobile, so you can take them
        wherever you want.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What Kind of Investment Is a Tiny Home?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>One
        of the things people love most about tiny homes is their endless customizability,
        which also makes it difficult to answer the question of how much tiny homes
        cost.<\/p>\n<p>Given that they are easily personalized, this makes it difficult
        to find an average price for tiny homes, as size, materials, and finishes
        can vary greatly. The figure runs from about $8,000 for a DIY tiny home with
        minimal fixtures all the way up to $150,000 and beyond for a custom-built
        tiny home with luxe fittings and features, according to Home Advisor.<\/p>\n<p>The
        biggest factors in pricing out a tiny home are materials and labor costs.
        Anyone who&rsquo;s worked with a contractor can tell you that those items
        aren&rsquo;t cheap.<\/p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re willing to do a large portion
        of the work yourself, you can significantly lower the cost of your home. When
        looking at a tiny home as an investment, you have to put a dollar value on
        your own labor. This tells you the real cost, in both money and time spent,
        of building one.<\/p>\n<p>Materials are the next largest pricing factor.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>If
        you&rsquo;re savvy and willing to spend some time researching, you can often
        find reclaimed materials or leftovers from a job site.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There
        are entire stores that sell nothing but the extra parts and slightly damaged
        fixtures from major building companies. These stores are often local businesses,
        so a quick Google search should bring up the appropriate place to go depending
        on your location.<\/p>\n<p>Tiny living can be either inexpensive or about
        the cost of a small starter home. Try finding a $100,000 home with truly top-of-the-line
        fittings.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"aff-cta\"><label>Estimate Your Monthly Mortgage
        Payment With Taxes, Fees, and Insurance<\/label> Calculate Your Payments Here<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The
        Cost of Living in a Tiny Home<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Living in a tiny home can
        be incredibly affordable. Heating, cooling, and cleaning 300 square feet is
        a whole lot cheaper and easier than doing so for a 2,322-square-foot home
        (the median new home size in 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>You
        can reduce your water, power, and other bills even further if you choose to
        live a sustainability focused lifestyle.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Solar
        panels, well water, and options such as a wood stove for heating can drop
        your living expenses substantially and shrink your carbon footprint.<\/p>\n<p>There
        are other expenses to consider, though, especially if you&rsquo;re living
        in a tiny house on wheels and plan to travel. Gas, insurance, and campground
        fees can add up fast.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Finding a Place to Live<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>One
        thing that you have to take into account when considering the cost and value
        of tiny living is where you live. Most American cities aren&rsquo;t tiny-home
        friendly. Many zoning laws prohibit full-time tiny-home habitation across
        the board.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you plan to stay in one place, you have to find
        land that allows tiny homes and has the necessary improvements with water,
        sewage, and electrical hookups. Many tiny-home dwellers get around this by
        living on family land or going out into a more rural area.<\/p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re
        more sustainably minded, a tiny home is one of the best ways to explore alternative
        lifestyles. This allows you to disconnect from traditional ways of Western
        life and see what living off the grid can be like.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Resale
        Market<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you just go by all the reality shows and hype
        you&rsquo;d think the tiny home market was absolutely booming. The reality
        is, well, a <em>tiny<\/em> bit different.<\/p>\n<p>Tiny homes are popular,
        in a big way. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that everyone, or even most people,
        are willing to live in one.<\/p>\n<p>Ask any real estate agent about home
        renovations, and they&rsquo;ll advise you to go for broader appeal. Look for
        the improvements that match the largest portion of the market&rsquo;s taste
        and try not to over customize.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>About 56 percent of Americans
        would consider living in a tiny home, according to a survey by IPX 1031, a
        Fidelity National financial company. Anything that has such a limited market
        &mdash; or liquidity &mdash; is going to be harder to sell.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Taking
        Out a Loan<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The biggest selling point for tiny homes is
        that you don&rsquo;t need to take out a mortgage, according to Hannah Maman,
        a real estate agent in Phoenix.<\/p>\n<p>You won&rsquo;t find a traditional
        home loan for a tiny house because most mortgage lenders have minimum loan
        amounts that are much higher than the one needed for a tiny house.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally,
        typical mortgage lenders won&rsquo;t give out a loan because many tiny houses
        are on wheels\/transportable and not on a foundation, and most lenders require
        a permanent foundation.<\/p>\n<p>That said, Maman explains that you can finance
        directly through a builder or take out either a personal loan or an RV loan.
        If you are to take out an RV loan for a tiny house, it must first be certified
        under the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association (to show it&rsquo;s safe
        for the road). You can expect to get about 4 to 9 percent interest rates here
        on a term of 70 to 85 months.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you aren&rsquo;t association
        certified and would rather take out a personal loan, this is doable. It would
        just be an unsecured personal loan with a higher interest rate, in the 7 to
        11 percent range.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;So many individuals are struggling with
        debt and are looking for viable alternatives to being locked into a 30-year
        mortgage,&rdquo; Maman says.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>&ldquo;Even
        maintenance and utility bills are cut in half, which saves people a ton of
        money.&rdquo;<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, Maman
        states, &ldquo;I think people need to be aware that buying a tiny home, in
        most cases, isn&rsquo;t the same as buying a traditional home.&rdquo; Continue
        reading below to find out why this kind of investment may not be for you.<\/p>\n<p><span
        class=\"aff-cta\"><label>Estimate Your Monthly Mortgage Payment With Taxes,
        Fees, and Insurance<\/label> Calculate Your Payments Here<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Do
        Tiny Homes Appreciate in Value?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Best answer: It&rsquo;s
        complicated. Traditional wisdom tells us owning a house over a long period
        of time &mdash; say at least five years &mdash; can be a good way to grow
        your money. After all, don&rsquo;t homes grow in value over time?<\/p>\n<p>Not
        always.<\/p>\n<p>The land that your home sits on may appreciate in value,
        but the physical house is actually depreciating. The same thing holds true
        for tiny homes, with the added twist that you don&rsquo;t usually own any
        land under them.<\/p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t expect your tiny home to appreciate
        in value like a traditional home, advises Noaz Miller, a home-insurance specialist
        in Scottsdale, Arizona. Location is the key factor that predicts valuation,
        he adds.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Land typically appreciates or depreciates with the
        local market,&rdquo; Miller says. Any traditional home with a permanent foundation
        will have better resale value than a tiny home on wheels, which will depreciate
        in value like an RV.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Tiny Homes as Passive Income Investments<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If
        you&rsquo;re renting out a tiny home, it could be a source of passive income,
        as is any other rental property. But be aware that there are a host of considerations
        to consider before becoming a landlord, such as state and local laws.<\/p>\n<p>A
        landlord should use a legally reviewed template for their state when creating
        a lease. States vary in terms of their protections for tenants and landlords,
        so ensure you protect yourself as much as possible in the event that any tenant
        falls far enough behind on rent that legal intervention is needed.<\/p>\n<p>One
        should also take into careful consideration the financial aspects of maintaining
        the property. Last, be sure to screen your tenants. As problems arise, you
        will likely be the one responsible for fixing them.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The
        Downsides of Tiny Homes<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in
        living in a tiny home, take care to consider the effects that the size of
        tiny homes can have on your life. Sure, it would be awesome to travel the
        world in a tiny home on wheels, but the little rational voice might start
        screaming, &ldquo;No! You don&rsquo;t have a remote job, so you can&rsquo;t
        just pick up and go.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>You also may need more than 500 square
        feet of space. If you ever intend to host friends and have family stay with
        you, you need more than one bedroom and bathroom.<\/p>\n<p>Not to mention
        the difficult regulations that you would have to abide by if you built your
        own tiny home. Most tiny homes have wheels to avoid the zoning laws in the
        city, leaving owners scrambling to find a place to park it legally. Some might
        be able to put it in the backyard of a regular home, but the area must have
        the proper zoning to accommodate full-time camping.<\/p>\n<p>If the tiny house
        has a foundation and isn&rsquo;t on wheels, it would have to comply with building
        codes, which usually means it must be a minimum of 700 square feet. For that
        reason, many people turn to rural areas where land is less expensive to build
        and park their tiny homes.<\/p>\n<p>But if you&rsquo;re a city person, it
        may not be practical for you to live out in the woods.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The
        Bottom Line<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>A tiny home can be a great investment for
        the right person. If you want to build your own house, travel the country
        with it, and embrace an alternative lifestyle, a tiny home can be an affordable
        way to accomplish this.<\/p>\n<p>You can customize the home almost endlessly
        and save money on rent and utilities. It also allows you to take the comforts
        of home to all kinds of wild and beautiful places.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to
        go tiny with an eye toward reselling your home down the line and realizing
        gains, you may be disappointed. Tiny homes depreciate and can be difficult
        to sell, so they might not make good investments in that sense. And if you
        want to live in a major city, it can be difficult and expensive to find somewhere
        to do so.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"aff-cta\"><label>Get a Free Quote for a Home

        Diet: The Ups and Downs","post_content":"<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-\/\/W3C\/\/DTD

        encoding=\"utf-8\" ?><html><body><p>Instead of trying to save money on groceries,
        I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I
        <em>did<\/em> stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.<\/p>\n<p>Soylent
        is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not
        a chef, and it&rsquo;s engineered to give your body everything you need to
        function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone,
        and &mdash; in theory &mdash; should still lead a perfectly normal life.<\/p>\n<p>Changing
        your lifestyle to this extent isn&rsquo;t as abnormal as you may think. In
        the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion,
        according to IBISWorld.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Time Is Money<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The
        Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn&rsquo;t
        about money &mdash; it was about time.<\/p>\n<p>You may think I&rsquo;m being
        stingy with my time, but I&rsquo;m young. Think of all the time I would save
        by not having to cook. That would effectively add months to my life! I also
        wouldn&rsquo;t have to grocery shop very often (never, really). Soylent can
        be delivered to my door.<\/p>\n<p>The second reason I found it so appealing
        was for health reasons. Stay with me, because I&rsquo;m about to get pretty
        holistic about life.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>I love automation. Automation
        means you can set something good in motion and have it run without you.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This
        means you can do awesome things without constant motivation. Think automatic
        bill pay or 401(k) contributions.<\/p>\n<p>Without Soylent, I&rsquo;m constantly
        having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day.
        That means I&rsquo;m having to consciously make healthy choices three-plus
        times per day, so I sometimes don&rsquo;t eat as healthy as I should. With
        Soylent, I can be healthy without having to worry about the ingredients.<\/p>\n<p>Of
        course, I wouldn&rsquo;t replace <em>all<\/em> my meals with Soylent. But
        many of my boring meals would get replaced.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Vacation Meals
        on a Budget<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The final reason Soylent caught my eye is
        the cost. Prices vary based on the amount and whether it&rsquo;s in bottled
        or powder form for you to mix, but it&rsquo;s around $3 per bottle, or $3
        per meal.<\/p>\n<p>Though that&rsquo;s more expensive than most home-cooked
        meals, it saves a lot of money when traveling or just being out and about.
        Instead of needing to buy a meal, you can just pull a bottle out of your backpack
        or purse, and crack it open.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"aff-cta\"><label>Save

        Start of a New Diet<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>I ordered my first round of Soylent
        a month ago straight from the website. The package arrived three days later.
        I opened the box and inside were a dozen white plastic bottles with black
        caps.<\/p>\n<p>I waited to try one until the next day &mdash; I wanted to
        start with an empty stomach so I could get the full effect. That morning,
        I tried my first sip. It was oddly delicious. I was surprised.<\/p>\n<p>Soylent
        is designed to have a neutral flavor so that the consumer doesn&rsquo;t get
        sick of the taste. But still, it was slightly sweet. Soylent subtly smells
        and tastes of a graham cracker and looks like a light cappuccino.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>An
        Epic Diet Fail<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>About 20 minutes later, I felt like I had
        the flu. I ate some &ldquo;real&rdquo; food and the flu-like symptoms disappeared.
        I tried more Soylent the next day. Same reaction. I tried two more times &mdash;
        same reaction again.<\/p>\n<p>I drank part of one right before doing 45 minutes
        of a cardio workout to check my energy levels. Exercising with the actual
        flu would&rsquo;ve been easier.<\/p>\n<p>I Googled my symptoms. My reaction
        was very rare. It&rsquo;s most likely the vanillin flavoring was to blame.
        And with that, my Soylent diet journey came to an abrupt end.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Although
        my experience is negative, I still recommend you give it a try.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I
        got my mom, dad, and cousin to drink Soylent, and they all really enjoyed
        it. At least <em>they<\/em> can save time, enjoy better health, and save money.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll
        continue my quest for a meal replacement beverage. So long, Soylent.<\/p>\n<p>Jamie
        Sullivan, director of communication at Soylent, says: &ldquo;We know many
        people use our products to save both time and money and are able to do so
        successfully. However, we <strong>do not recommend <\/strong>anyone switching
        to a Soylent only diet.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Additionally, we always recommend
        everyone connect with their doctor or dietitian to decide the best overall
        meal plan to support your personal health goals and nutrition plan,&rdquo;
        Sullivan adds.<\/p>\n<p>CentSai does not recommend changing your lifestyle
        or dietary habits without consulting your physician.<\/p>\n<p><\/p><\/body><\/html>\n","post_image":null,"post_url":null,"canonical_url":"https:\/\/centsai.com\/save-money\/frugality\/soylent-diet-ups-and-downs\/","post_date":null,"six_second_take":null,"author_id":null,"author_name":null,"author_url":null,"author_image":null,"category_id":null,"category_name":null,"category_link":null,"sponsored_content":null,"sponsored_image":null,"sponsored_url":null,"video_url":"","podcast_url":"","featured_partner":null,"featured_partner_url":null,"featured_part_desc":null,"featured_part_img":null},{"post_id":80398,"post_template":"infographics","post_title":"[INFOGRAPHIC]
