&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to save money on groceries, I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I did stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not a chef, and it’s engineered to give your body everything you need to function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone, and — in theory — should still lead a perfectly normal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing your lifestyle to this extent isn’t as abnormal as you may think. In the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion, according to IBISWorld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Time Is Money
&lt;p&gt;The Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn’t about money — it was about time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think I’m being stingy with my time, but I’m young. Think of all the time I would save by not having to cook. That would effectively add months to my life! I also wouldn’t have to grocery shop very often (never, really). Soylent can be delivered to my door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason I found it so appealing was for health reasons. Stay with me, because I’m about to get pretty holistic about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love automation. Automation means you can set something good in motion and have it run without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can do awesome things without constant motivation. Think automatic bill pay or 401(k) contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Soylent, I’m constantly having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day. That means I’m having to consciously make healthy choices three-plus times per day, so I sometimes don’t eat as healthy as I should. With Soylent, I can be healthy without having to worry about the ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I wouldn’t replace all my meals with Soylent. But many of my boring meals would get replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
Vacation Meals on a Budget
&lt;p&gt;The final reason Soylent caught my eye is the cost. Prices vary based on the amount and whether it’s in bottled or powder form for you to mix, but it’s around $3 per bottle, or $3 per meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though that’s more expensive than most home-cooked meals, it saves a lot of money when traveling or just being out and about. Instead of needing to buy a meal, you can just pull a bottle out of your backpack or purse, and crack it open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Chris: “Purple Carrot delivers a box with three vegan meals to prepare a week. The best part is that it comes with a little cookbook each time. I just buy the ingredients later on if I want to make a recipe again. It got me out of a rut of making me the same stuff…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuart: “I make my own chicken broth from store-bought rotisserie chickens. I hate using fresh onion, carrot or celery just for broth. I developed the habit of taking scraps of the three when I cook and storing them in a container in the freezer. When I need to make broth, I just dump it into my instant pot with my chicken. Saves time and money.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teresa: “Pay attention to how often your favorite products go on sale and stock up on enough to last you until the next cycle. There is a fairly predictable sales cycle.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrick: “Instant Pot. Two magic words.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tonia: “If you have the space, get a big box or upright extra freezer. Make massive batches of dishes like taco meat, slow-cooked pork, pot roast, Indian curry, rice dishes of any kind, etc. Batch them into containers so there’s no cooking during the week. We do this and order in once a week. We keep fresh broccoli, string beans and cauliflower in large Tupperware containers pre-cut and cleaned and quickly pan-fry or steam them in minutes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lisa: “Instacart. Restaurant Depot allows you to order from them to your home since the pandemic started. It’s basically Costco for restaurants.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arindam: “1-800-DIY.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kristen: “HelloFresh has saved me the headache of what to make and shopping for ingredients.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diane: “Make a big batch of pasta sauce or chili on Sunday, freeze some and eat some throughout the week.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
          
The Start of a New Diet
&lt;p&gt;I ordered my first round of Soylent a month ago straight from the website. The package arrived three days later. I opened the box and inside were a dozen white plastic bottles with black caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited to try one until the next day — I wanted to start with an empty stomach so I could get the full effect. That morning, I tried my first sip. It was oddly delicious. I was surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is designed to have a neutral flavor so that the consumer doesn’t get sick of the taste. But still, it was slightly sweet. Soylent subtly smells and tastes of a graham cracker and looks like a light cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;
An Epic Diet Fail
&lt;p&gt;About 20 minutes later, I felt like I had the flu. I ate some “real” food and the flu-like symptoms disappeared. I tried more Soylent the next day. Same reaction. I tried two more times — same reaction again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drank part of one right before doing 45 minutes of a cardio workout to check my energy levels. Exercising with the actual flu would’ve been easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Googled my symptoms. My reaction was very rare. It’s most likely the vanillin flavoring was to blame. And with that, my Soylent diet journey came to an abrupt end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my experience is negative, I still recommend you give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my mom, dad, and cousin to drink Soylent, and they all really enjoyed it. At least they can save time, enjoy better health, and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll continue my quest for a meal replacement beverage. So long, Soylent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Sullivan, director of communication at Soylent, says: “We know many people use our products to save both time and money and are able to do so successfully. However, we do not recommend anyone switching to a Soylent only diet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we always recommend everyone connect with their doctor or dietitian to decide the best overall meal plan to support your personal health goals and nutrition plan,” Sullivan adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentSai does not recommend changing your lifestyle or dietary habits without consulting your physician.&lt;/p&gt;

]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>80405</guid><title>The Best Methodologies for Teaching Financial Literacy</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy continues to make slow strides in gaining attention, while discussions of appropriate methodologies in a school setting remain scant. The lack of sufficient attention to methodology has hindered progress; many programs lack meaningful evaluation and longitudinal studies are few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a circular problem: It is difficult to get support to expand programs when there is a lack of verifiable evidence of their effectiveness, which makes it more difficult to move forward and gain that evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A saving grace is the vast need for financial literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and people are visibly getting left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Financial Literacy Mandates
&lt;p&gt;There continues to be slow progress in the number of states requiring some form of personal financial literacy education as a high school graduation requirement. It’s now about half, which is significant, but it is clearly not where we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few states, however, require students to take a stand-alone course in personal finance. More require personal finance education integrated with other coursework. Mandates are great, but they don’t mean that it actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is concerning to see young people graduating high school barely able to read or write; there can be little confidence that they somehow attained reasonable financial literacy education while missing out on reading in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mandates are not always being followed. Schools face many challenges, and states aren’t going to push very hard on getting those who can’t read to be good with money. They probably feel they have bigger problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State financial literacy education mandates in schools are important but not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
The Feedback Challenge
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy education should make a lifetime of difference. All too often results are either not measured or measured at a point in time. And the focus tends to be on knowledge alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is important, but financial literacy is a skill; you need to apply it and use it to develop the skill. You learn skills through practicing with knowledge — both knowledge and experience are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a lot like welding — you can read a bunch of books but that does not make you competent with a torch. You need both knowledge and experience to be a good welder, as you need both knowledge and experience to be competent at any skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t matter if it is baking or flying or financial literacy, knowledge does little without experience, and experience can be an expensive and dangerous teacher in the absence of knowledge. They are inseparable; neither has meaningful value alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a classroom, there are options to develop the skills of financial literacy, just as you would with welding or baking. Financial literacy skills can be developed with cases and games, with interactive tools and with competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands-on training provides the learner with a feedback loop. They take an action and a consequence develops. Knowledge training without an experiential component is better than nothing, but it cannot compete with experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ideal situation is directly hands on. Games are a great substitute, but not the only option. Case studies, learning from stories and critiquing the actions of others, even simple exercises can add a hands-on component to knowledge training and improve the likelihood of long-term improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge has the singular advantage of being easy to test and evaluate. Assessments can measure knowledge gains whereas skill development is harder to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
Program Elements
&lt;p&gt;Effective financial literacy education needs to develop several skills. Some are overlooked in knowledge-based programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially literate, you need to be able to evaluate financial alternatives. This can be useful in day-to-day activities like comparison shopping and is essential for major purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people should be able to compare mortgage options and make a reasonable choice based on their situation and should be able to evaluate choices like leasing a car versus buying a car. Financial decision-making is an essential financial literacy skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using technology in finance is important and growing in importance. There are fantastic tools available to assist individuals in a myriad of financial challenges. But using powerful tools without knowledge of the consequences can be a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to not only know how to use technology — that’s the easy part — but they also need to know when to use technology and what the potential risks are. It is too easy to invest in risky investments with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can experience negative consequences without even knowing the consequences were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology can be wonderful and powerful, or it can be crippling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud awareness and preventing it needs to be an element of a good financial education. It has been bad out there, and it is getting worse. People need to know how to protect themselves, and where to find out what to watch for as the bad people get better at what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Behavioral Finance
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral finance can no longer be ignored. In school, individuals need to learn about the behavioral aspects of financial literacy and how to deal with the biggest obstacle they will face on their journey to financial success: themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is an emotional topic. Emotions can cause people to make suboptimal decisions. Car dealers know this. You should too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to learn about the risks behavior brings to the table — and how to combat those risks. There must be proactive to solutions to deal with our human tendencies, which do not serve us well as long-term accumulators. The more we understand and are aware of our own shortcomings the greater our ability to overcome them and achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets and volatility are not what holds investors back; behaviors in the face of market conditions and volatility are what holds investors back. Behavioral finance is an essential component of financial literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
Systems Thinking
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy can benefit from systems thinking. Nothing occurs without impacting other things. This is as true in financial matters as it is in any other system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you increase your 401(k) contributions, for example, it impacts not only your retirement preparedness, but also your cash flow and your taxes and may impact other areas of your financial life. Any single change has the potential for multiple consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, financial literacy and financial matters occur within larger systems. An individual’s numeracy skills are a codeterminant of their financial capability. Those with low numeracy skills are more likely to struggle financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numeracy education is not financial education, but supports financial education. Those challenged by numeracy need to gain knowledge of and comfort with other tools to assist with numeracy.&lt;/p&gt;
Talk It to Death
&lt;p&gt;A major aim of basic financial literacy programs is to raise awareness while developing rudimentary skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can help. We can help in our families and we can help in our workplaces. And we can help by simply talking it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can and should talk about financial matters at home. We should talk about budgets and we should talk about the process of evaluating financial alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children who grow up in a home where the parents smoke are more likely to smoke; children who grow up in homes where the parents demonstrate financial awareness and restraint are similarly more likely to pick up these habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t demonstrate the habits you don’t want the kids to pick up, and repeat the habits you would like them to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us can talk up financial literacy at work. We can be advocates for the 401(k) or other retirement plans. We can be advocates for debt reduction and we can be advocates for emergency funds and we can be advocates for budgets. And we can do that without being obnoxious. People don’t like to be told what to do, but they do love stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a passion for financial literacy or financial wellness, you can share that passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be surprised not only by how many people are interested, but also that they will make changes and be excited to tell you of their own progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk it up. Stories are a very powerful teaching tool. Talk it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;There is no silver bullet for financial illiteracy. Amazing things are happening, but we still have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy is a complex skill and we can spend a lifetime continually learning new things. But we won’t if we don’t have a solid start. Financial literacy education needs to build the foundation upon which individuals can build the financial lives they wish to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep the idea of skill or capability as a guiding principle. Knowledge of the difference among investment types is nice but evaluating those differences is essential. The skills can be used in changing situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many tools that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help. There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day. There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy the bigger difference we can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum in which we present may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always enhance financial literacy education in schools by making it experiential. That is what people will most carry forward; that is where the difference is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>We can and should talk about financial matters at home. We should talk about budgets and we should talk about the process of evaluating financial alternatives.</p>
<p>Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents</p>
<p>Children who grow up in a home where the parents smoke are more likely to smoke; children who grow up in homes where the parents demonstrate financial awareness and restraint are similarly more likely to pick up these habits.</p>
<p>Don’t demonstrate the habits you don’t want the kids to pick up, and repeat the habits you would like them to obtain.</p>
<p>Many of us can talk up financial literacy at work. We can be advocates for the 401(k) or other retirement plans. We can be advocates for debt reduction and we can be advocates for emergency funds and we can be advocates for budgets. And we can do that without being obnoxious. People don’t like to be told what to do, but they do love stories.</p>
<p>If you have a passion for financial literacy or financial wellness, you can share that passion.</p>
<p>You may be surprised not only by how many people are interested, but also that they will make changes and be excited to tell you of their own progress.</p>
<p>Talk it up. Stories are a very powerful teaching tool. Talk it to death.</p>
The Bottom Line
<p>There is no silver bullet for financial illiteracy. Amazing things are happening, but we still have a long way to go.</p>
<p>Financial literacy is a complex skill and we can spend a lifetime continually learning new things. But we won’t if we don’t have a solid start. Financial literacy education needs to build the foundation upon which individuals can build the financial lives they wish to have.</p>
<p>We need to keep the idea of skill or capability as a guiding principle. Knowledge of the difference among investment types is nice but evaluating those differences is essential. The skills can be used in changing situations.</p>
<p>There are many tools that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help. There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day. There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy the bigger difference we can make.</p>
<p>The forum in which we present may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always enhance financial literacy education in schools by making it experiential. That is what people will most carry forward; that is where the difference is made.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Perusing social media might lead you to believe that frugality is the essence of financial literacy. Not necessarily. Frugal people rarely own airplanes or yachts. The 47 percent of Americans who are financially literate and budget-conscious, according to Harris Insights and Analytics, very well might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frugal people focus on not wasting money — on minimizing their expenses. This can be difficult for low-income households to manage thanks to liquidity restraints, according to a report in the Journal of Marketing Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though those low-income households stand to benefit the most from frugal strategies, such as the ability to buy in bulk, they are unfortunately unable to put those strategies into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people, on the other hand, understand the consequences of their financial decisions and act accordingly. They use financial resources intentionally. Financially literate people focus on making good money decisions. And the best decision often isn’t the most frugal one.&lt;/p&gt;
Living Within Your Means
&lt;p&gt;The common ground between frugality and financial literacy is living within your means. But the two approaches are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of doing well financially, living within one’s means requires that the sum of one’s expenses and savings must be at or below one’s income. This principle transcends both ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially successful, one has to live within one’s means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “means equation” says that we get to spend no more than we make. The frugality camp focuses on minimizing the expenses side of the equation. Unfortunately, neglecting the revenue side can be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
Reducing Expenses vs. Increasing Revenue
&lt;p&gt;It should be fairly apparent that there’s more room to change the revenue side of the equation than the expense side — at least theoretically. Changes to the expense side of the equation are limited to the total of the expenses — you can’t reduce your expenses beyond zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revenue side does not have this barrier. The revenue side is, theoretically, infinitely changeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get Matched With a Financial Adviser Most Suited to Your Unique Needs Maximize Your Retirement Efforts Today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a variety of challenges when it comes to making dramatic increases in the revenue side of the equation. This is especially true in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing one’s income can take a lot of time and hard work. It can also require you to make an intermediate investment, such as getting training or education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, frugality — much like laziness — pays off immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is frugality’s great benefit. Frugality as a tool can help us to navigate times of low income, such as a period of unemployment. Frugality can also help us to push out additional savings to meet a short-term goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually, a frugal lifestyle often burns us out. Living “without” robs us of many simple pleasures. It robs us of the emotional peace of enjoying simple things because it makes us believe that we’re bad for wasting money on ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
Frugality vs. Financial Literacy: The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;In the long term, we need to tell frugality to pound salt. We need to understand that our self-worth is not equal to the number of pennies saved, and we will buy that damn ice cream if we want. Some of those little expenses contribute to self-care, which is important for our mental and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy — making informed and intentional financial decisions — allows us to do what we want, if we’re willing. If we’re willing to understand the ramifications of our decisions, then the sky’s the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the sea’s the limit, depending on whether you picked the airplane or the yacht. It’s all about decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, you can have anything that you’re willing to earn and build for. Or you can spend less and have what’s left over. Frugality is a tool. Financial literacy is the whole tool set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ball is in your court. Choose wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to save money on groceries, I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I did stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not a chef, and it’s engineered to give your body everything you need to function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone, and — in theory — should still lead a perfectly normal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing your lifestyle to this extent isn’t as abnormal as you may think. In the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion, according to IBISWorld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Time Is Money
&lt;p&gt;The Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn’t about money — it was about time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think I’m being stingy with my time, but I’m young. Think of all the time I would save by not having to cook. That would effectively add months to my life! I also wouldn’t have to grocery shop very often (never, really). Soylent can be delivered to my door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason I found it so appealing was for health reasons. Stay with me, because I’m about to get pretty holistic about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love automation. Automation means you can set something good in motion and have it run without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can do awesome things without constant motivation. Think automatic bill pay or 401(k) contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Soylent, I’m constantly having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day. That means I’m having to consciously make healthy choices three-plus times per day, so I sometimes don’t eat as healthy as I should. With Soylent, I can be healthy without having to worry about the ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I wouldn’t replace all my meals with Soylent. But many of my boring meals would get replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
Vacation Meals on a Budget
&lt;p&gt;The final reason Soylent caught my eye is the cost. Prices vary based on the amount and whether it’s in bottled or powder form for you to mix, but it’s around $3 per bottle, or $3 per meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though that’s more expensive than most home-cooked meals, it saves a lot of money when traveling or just being out and about. Instead of needing to buy a meal, you can just pull a bottle out of your backpack or purse, and crack it open.&lt;/p&gt;

			Food Hacks That Save Our Readers Time and Money
            &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris: “Purple Carrot delivers a box with three vegan meals to prepare a week. The best part is that it comes with a little cookbook each time. I just buy the ingredients later on if I want to make a recipe again. It got me out of a rut of making me the same stuff…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuart: “I make my own chicken broth from store-bought rotisserie chickens. I hate using fresh onion, carrot or celery just for broth. I developed the habit of taking scraps of the three when I cook and storing them in a container in the freezer. When I need to make broth, I just dump it into my instant pot with my chicken. Saves time and money.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teresa: “Pay attention to how often your favorite products go on sale and stock up on enough to last you until the next cycle. There is a fairly predictable sales cycle.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrick: “Instant Pot. Two magic words.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tonia: “If you have the space, get a big box or upright extra freezer. Make massive batches of dishes like taco meat, slow-cooked pork, pot roast, Indian curry, rice dishes of any kind, etc. Batch them into containers so there’s no cooking during the week. We do this and order in once a week. We keep fresh broccoli, string beans and cauliflower in large Tupperware containers pre-cut and cleaned and quickly pan-fry or steam them in minutes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lisa: “Instacart. Restaurant Depot allows you to order from them to your home since the pandemic started. It’s basically Costco for restaurants.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arindam: “1-800-DIY.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kristen: “HelloFresh has saved me the headache of what to make and shopping for ingredients.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diane: “Make a big batch of pasta sauce or chili on Sunday, freeze some and eat some throughout the week.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
          
The Start of a New Diet
&lt;p&gt;I ordered my first round of Soylent a month ago straight from the website. The package arrived three days later. I opened the box and inside were a dozen white plastic bottles with black caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited to try one until the next day — I wanted to start with an empty stomach so I could get the full effect. That morning, I tried my first sip. It was oddly delicious. I was surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is designed to have a neutral flavor so that the consumer doesn’t get sick of the taste. But still, it was slightly sweet. Soylent subtly smells and tastes of a graham cracker and looks like a light cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;
An Epic Diet Fail
&lt;p&gt;About 20 minutes later, I felt like I had the flu. I ate some “real” food and the flu-like symptoms disappeared. I tried more Soylent the next day. Same reaction. I tried two more times — same reaction again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drank part of one right before doing 45 minutes of a cardio workout to check my energy levels. Exercising with the actual flu would’ve been easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Googled my symptoms. My reaction was very rare. It’s most likely the vanillin flavoring was to blame. And with that, my Soylent diet journey came to an abrupt end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my experience is negative, I still recommend you give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my mom, dad, and cousin to drink Soylent, and they all really enjoyed it. At least they can save time, enjoy better health, and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll continue my quest for a meal replacement beverage. So long, Soylent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Sullivan, director of communication at Soylent, says: “We know many people use our products to save both time and money and are able to do so successfully. However, we do not recommend anyone switching to a Soylent only diet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we always recommend everyone connect with their doctor or dietitian to decide the best overall meal plan to support your personal health goals and nutrition plan,” Sullivan adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentSai does not recommend changing your lifestyle or dietary habits without consulting your physician.&lt;/p&gt;

]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>80405</guid><title>The Best Methodologies for Teaching Financial Literacy</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy continues to make slow strides in gaining attention, while discussions of appropriate methodologies in a school setting remain scant. The lack of sufficient attention to methodology has hindered progress; many programs lack meaningful evaluation and longitudinal studies are few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a circular problem: It is difficult to get support to expand programs when there is a lack of verifiable evidence of their effectiveness, which makes it more difficult to move forward and gain that evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A saving grace is the vast need for financial literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and people are visibly getting left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Financial Literacy Mandates
&lt;p&gt;There continues to be slow progress in the number of states requiring some form of personal financial literacy education as a high school graduation requirement. It’s now about half, which is significant, but it is clearly not where we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few states, however, require students to take a stand-alone course in personal finance. More require personal finance education integrated with other coursework. Mandates are great, but they don’t mean that it actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is concerning to see young people graduating high school barely able to read or write; there can be little confidence that they somehow attained reasonable financial literacy education while missing out on reading in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mandates are not always being followed. Schools face many challenges, and states aren’t going to push very hard on getting those who can’t read to be good with money. They probably feel they have bigger problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State financial literacy education mandates in schools are important but not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
The Feedback Challenge
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy education should make a lifetime of difference. All too often results are either not measured or measured at a point in time. And the focus tends to be on knowledge alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is important, but financial literacy is a skill; you need to apply it and use it to develop the skill. You learn skills through practicing with knowledge — both knowledge and experience are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a lot like welding — you can read a bunch of books but that does not make you competent with a torch. You need both knowledge and experience to be a good welder, as you need both knowledge and experience to be competent at any skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t matter if it is baking or flying or financial literacy, knowledge does little without experience, and experience can be an expensive and dangerous teacher in the absence of knowledge. They are inseparable; neither has meaningful value alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a classroom, there are options to develop the skills of financial literacy, just as you would with welding or baking. Financial literacy skills can be developed with cases and games, with interactive tools and with competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands-on training provides the learner with a feedback loop. They take an action and a consequence develops. Knowledge training without an experiential component is better than nothing, but it cannot compete with experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ideal situation is directly hands on. Games are a great substitute, but not the only option. Case studies, learning from stories and critiquing the actions of others, even simple exercises can add a hands-on component to knowledge training and improve the likelihood of long-term improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge has the singular advantage of being easy to test and evaluate. Assessments can measure knowledge gains whereas skill development is harder to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
Program Elements
&lt;p&gt;Effective financial literacy education needs to develop several skills. Some are overlooked in knowledge-based programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially literate, you need to be able to evaluate financial alternatives. This can be useful in day-to-day activities like comparison shopping and is essential for major purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people should be able to compare mortgage options and make a reasonable choice based on their situation and should be able to evaluate choices like leasing a car versus buying a car. Financial decision-making is an essential financial literacy skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using technology in finance is important and growing in importance. There are fantastic tools available to assist individuals in a myriad of financial challenges. But using powerful tools without knowledge of the consequences can be a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to not only know how to use technology — that’s the easy part — but they also need to know when to use technology and what the potential risks are. It is too easy to invest in risky investments with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can experience negative consequences without even knowing the consequences were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology can be wonderful and powerful, or it can be crippling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud awareness and preventing it needs to be an element of a good financial education. It has been bad out there, and it is getting worse. People need to know how to protect themselves, and where to find out what to watch for as the bad people get better at what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Behavioral Finance
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral finance can no longer be ignored. In school, individuals need to learn about the behavioral aspects of financial literacy and how to deal with the biggest obstacle they will face on their journey to financial success: themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is an emotional topic. Emotions can cause people to make suboptimal decisions. Car dealers know this. You should too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to learn about the risks behavior brings to the table — and how to combat those risks. There must be proactive to solutions to deal with our human tendencies, which do not serve us well as long-term accumulators. The more we understand and are aware of our own shortcomings the greater our ability to overcome them and achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets and volatility are not what holds investors back; behaviors in the face of market conditions and volatility are what holds investors back. Behavioral finance is an essential component of financial literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
Systems Thinking
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy can benefit from systems thinking. Nothing occurs without impacting other things. This is as true in financial matters as it is in any other system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you increase your 401(k) contributions, for example, it impacts not only your retirement preparedness, but also your cash flow and your taxes and may impact other areas of your financial life. Any single change has the potential for multiple consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, financial literacy and financial matters occur within larger systems. An individual’s numeracy skills are a codeterminant of their financial capability. Those with low numeracy skills are more likely to struggle financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numeracy education is not financial education, but supports financial education. Those challenged by numeracy need to gain knowledge of and comfort with other tools to assist with numeracy.&lt;/p&gt;
Talk It to Death
&lt;p&gt;A major aim of basic financial literacy programs is to raise awareness while developing rudimentary skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can help. We can help in our families and we can help in our workplaces. And we can help by simply talking it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can and should talk about financial matters at home. We should talk about budgets and we should talk about the process of evaluating financial alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children who grow up in a home where the parents smoke are more likely to smoke; children who grow up in homes where the parents demonstrate financial awareness and restraint are similarly more likely to pick up these habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t demonstrate the habits you don’t want the kids to pick up, and repeat the habits you would like them to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us can talk up financial literacy at work. We can be advocates for the 401(k) or other retirement plans. We can be advocates for debt reduction and we can be advocates for emergency funds and we can be advocates for budgets. And we can do that without being obnoxious. People don’t like to be told what to do, but they do love stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a passion for financial literacy or financial wellness, you can share that passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be surprised not only by how many people are interested, but also that they will make changes and be excited to tell you of their own progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk it up. Stories are a very powerful teaching tool. Talk it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;There is no silver bullet for financial illiteracy. Amazing things are happening, but we still have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy is a complex skill and we can spend a lifetime continually learning new things. But we won’t if we don’t have a solid start. Financial literacy education needs to build the foundation upon which individuals can build the financial lives they wish to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep the idea of skill or capability as a guiding principle. Knowledge of the difference among investment types is nice but evaluating those differences is essential. The skills can be used in changing situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many tools that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help. There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day. There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy the bigger difference we can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum in which we present may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always enhance financial literacy education in schools by making it experiential. That is what people will most carry forward; that is where the difference is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Financial literacy continues to make slow strides in gaining attention, while discussions of appropriate methodologies in a school setting remain scant. The lack of sufficient attention to methodology has hindered progress; many programs lack meaningful evaluation and longitudinal studies are few.</p>
<p>This creates a circular problem: It is difficult to get support to expand programs when there is a lack of verifiable evidence of their effectiveness, which makes it more difficult to move forward and gain that evidence.</p>
<p>A saving grace is the vast need for financial literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and people are visibly getting left behind.</p>
<p></p>
Financial Literacy Mandates
<p>There continues to be slow progress in the number of states requiring some form of personal financial literacy education as a high school graduation requirement. It’s now about half, which is significant, but it is clearly not where we need to be.</p>
<p>Few states, however, require students to take a stand-alone course in personal finance. More require personal finance education integrated with other coursework. Mandates are great, but they don’t mean that it actually happens.</p>
<p>It is concerning to see young people graduating high school barely able to read or write; there can be little confidence that they somehow attained reasonable financial literacy education while missing out on reading in schools.</p>
<p>The mandates are not always being followed. Schools face many challenges, and states aren’t going to push very hard on getting those who can’t read to be good with money. They probably feel they have bigger problems.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Perusing social media might lead you to believe that frugality is the essence of financial literacy. Not necessarily. Frugal people rarely own airplanes or yachts. The 47 percent of Americans who are financially literate and budget-conscious, according to Harris Insights and Analytics, very well might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frugal people focus on not wasting money — on minimizing their expenses. This can be difficult for low-income households to manage thanks to liquidity restraints, according to a report in the Journal of Marketing Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though those low-income households stand to benefit the most from frugal strategies, such as the ability to buy in bulk, they are unfortunately unable to put those strategies into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people, on the other hand, understand the consequences of their financial decisions and act accordingly. They use financial resources intentionally. Financially literate people focus on making good money decisions. And the best decision often isn’t the most frugal one.&lt;/p&gt;
Living Within Your Means
&lt;p&gt;The common ground between frugality and financial literacy is living within your means. But the two approaches are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of doing well financially, living within one’s means requires that the sum of one’s expenses and savings must be at or below one’s income. This principle transcends both ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially successful, one has to live within one’s means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “means equation” says that we get to spend no more than we make. The frugality camp focuses on minimizing the expenses side of the equation. Unfortunately, neglecting the revenue side can be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
Reducing Expenses vs. Increasing Revenue
&lt;p&gt;It should be fairly apparent that there’s more room to change the revenue side of the equation than the expense side — at least theoretically. Changes to the expense side of the equation are limited to the total of the expenses — you can’t reduce your expenses beyond zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revenue side does not have this barrier. The revenue side is, theoretically, infinitely changeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get Matched With a Financial Adviser Most Suited to Your Unique Needs Maximize Your Retirement Efforts Today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a variety of challenges when it comes to making dramatic increases in the revenue side of the equation. This is especially true in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing one’s income can take a lot of time and hard work. It can also require you to make an intermediate investment, such as getting training or education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, frugality — much like laziness — pays off immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is frugality’s great benefit. Frugality as a tool can help us to navigate times of low income, such as a period of unemployment. Frugality can also help us to push out additional savings to meet a short-term goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually, a frugal lifestyle often burns us out. Living “without” robs us of many simple pleasures. It robs us of the emotional peace of enjoying simple things because it makes us believe that we’re bad for wasting money on ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
Frugality vs. Financial Literacy: The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;In the long term, we need to tell frugality to pound salt. We need to understand that our self-worth is not equal to the number of pennies saved, and we will buy that damn ice cream if we want. Some of those little expenses contribute to self-care, which is important for our mental and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy — making informed and intentional financial decisions — allows us to do what we want, if we’re willing. If we’re willing to understand the ramifications of our decisions, then the sky’s the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the sea’s the limit, depending on whether you picked the airplane or the yacht. It’s all about decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, you can have anything that you’re willing to earn and build for. Or you can spend less and have what’s left over. Frugality is a tool. Financial literacy is the whole tool set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ball is in your court. Choose wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to save money on groceries, I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I did stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not a chef, and it’s engineered to give your body everything you need to function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone, and — in theory — should still lead a perfectly normal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing your lifestyle to this extent isn’t as abnormal as you may think. In the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion, according to IBISWorld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Time Is Money
&lt;p&gt;The Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn’t about money — it was about time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think I’m being stingy with my time, but I’m young. Think of all the time I would save by not having to cook. That would effectively add months to my life! I also wouldn’t have to grocery shop very often (never, really). Soylent can be delivered to my door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason I found it so appealing was for health reasons. Stay with me, because I’m about to get pretty holistic about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love automation. Automation means you can set something good in motion and have it run without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can do awesome things without constant motivation. Think automatic bill pay or 401(k) contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Soylent, I’m constantly having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day. That means I’m having to consciously make healthy choices three-plus times per day, so I sometimes don’t eat as healthy as I should. With Soylent, I can be healthy without having to worry about the ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I wouldn’t replace all my meals with Soylent. But many of my boring meals would get replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
Vacation Meals on a Budget
&lt;p&gt;The final reason Soylent caught my eye is the cost. Prices vary based on the amount and whether it’s in bottled or powder form for you to mix, but it’s around $3 per bottle, or $3 per meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though that’s more expensive than most home-cooked meals, it saves a lot of money when traveling or just being out and about. Instead of needing to buy a meal, you can just pull a bottle out of your backpack or purse, and crack it open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Chris: “Purple Carrot delivers a box with three vegan meals to prepare a week. The best part is that it comes with a little cookbook each time. I just buy the ingredients later on if I want to make a recipe again. It got me out of a rut of making me the same stuff…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuart: “I make my own chicken broth from store-bought rotisserie chickens. I hate using fresh onion, carrot or celery just for broth.

&lt;li&gt;Tonia: “If you have the space, get a big box or upright extra freezer.

&lt;/ul&gt;
          
The Start of a New Diet
&lt;p&gt;I ordered my first round of Soylent a month ago straight from the website. The package arrived three days later. I opened the box and inside were a dozen white plastic bottles with black caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited to try one until the next day — I wanted to start with an empty stomach so I could get the full effect. That morning, I tried my first sip. It was oddly delicious. I was surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is designed to have a neutral flavor so that the consumer doesn’t get sick of the taste. But still, it was slightly sweet. Soylent subtly smells and tastes of a graham cracker and looks like a light cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;
An Epic Diet Fail
&lt;p&gt;About 20 minutes later, I felt like I had the flu. I ate some “real” food and the flu-like symptoms disappeared. I tried more Soylent the next day. Same reaction. I tried two more times — same reaction again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drank part of one right before doing 45 minutes of a cardio workout to check my energy levels. Exercising with the actual flu would’ve been easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Googled my symptoms. My reaction was very rare. It’s most likely the vanillin flavoring was to blame. And with that, my Soylent diet journey came to an abrupt end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my experience is negative, I still recommend you give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my mom, dad, and cousin to drink Soylent, and they all really enjoyed it. At least they can save time, enjoy better health, and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll continue my quest for a meal replacement beverage. So long, Soylent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Sullivan, director of communication at Soylent, says: “We know many people use our products to save both time and money and are able to do so successfully. However, we do not recommend anyone switching to a Soylent only diet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we always recommend everyone connect with their doctor or dietitian to decide the best overall meal plan to support your personal health goals and nutrition plan,” Sullivan adds.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Instead of trying to save money on groceries, I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I did stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.</p>
<p>Soylent is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not a chef, and it’s engineered to give your body everything you need to function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone, and — in theory — should still lead a perfectly normal life.</p>
<p>Changing your lifestyle to this extent isn’t as abnormal as you may think. In the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion, according to IBISWorld.</p>
<p></p>
Time Is Money
<p>The Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn’t about money — it was about time.</p>
<p>You may think I’m being stingy with my time, but I’m young. Think of all the time I would save by not having to cook. That would effectively add months to my life! I also wouldn’t have to grocery shop very often (never, really). Soylent can be delivered to my door.</p>
<p>The second reason I found it so appealing was for health reasons. Stay with me, because I’m about to get pretty holistic about life.</p>
<p>I love automation. Automation means you can set something good in motion and have it run without you.</p>
<p>This means you can do awesome things without constant motivation. Think automatic bill pay or 401(k) contributions.</p>
<p>Without Soylent, I’m constantly having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day. That means I’m having to consciously make healthy choices three-plus times per day, so I sometimes don’t eat as healthy as I should. With Soylent, I can be healthy without having to worry about the ingredients.</p>
<p>Of course, I wouldn’t replace all my meals with Soylent. But many of my boring meals would get replaced.</p>

]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>80405</guid><title>The Best Methodologies for Teaching Financial Literacy</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy continues to make slow strides in gaining attention, while discussions of appropriate methodologies in a school setting remain scant. The lack of sufficient attention to methodology has hindered progress; many programs lack meaningful evaluation and longitudinal studies are few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a circular problem: It is difficult to get support to expand programs when there is a lack of verifiable evidence of their effectiveness, which makes it more difficult to move forward and gain that evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A saving grace is the vast need for financial literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and people are visibly getting left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Financial Literacy Mandates
&lt;p&gt;There continues to be slow progress in the number of states requiring some form of personal financial literacy education as a high school graduation requirement. It’s now about half, which is significant, but it is clearly not where we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few states, however, require students to take a stand-alone course in personal finance. More require personal finance education integrated with other coursework. Mandates are great, but they don’t mean that it actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is concerning to see young people graduating high school barely able to read or write; there can be little confidence that they somehow attained reasonable financial literacy education while missing out on reading in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mandates are not always being followed. Schools face many challenges, and states aren’t going to push very hard on getting those who can’t read to be good with money. They probably feel they have bigger problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State financial literacy education mandates in schools are important but not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
The Feedback Challenge
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy education should make a lifetime of difference. All too often results are either not measured or measured at a point in time. And the focus tends to be on knowledge alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is important, but financial literacy is a skill; you need to apply it and use it to develop the skill. You learn skills through practicing with knowledge — both knowledge and experience are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a lot like welding — you can read a bunch of books but that does not make you competent with a torch. You need both knowledge and experience to be a good welder, as you need both knowledge and experience to be competent at any skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t matter if it is baking or flying or financial literacy, knowledge does little without experience, and experience can be an expensive and dangerous teacher in the absence of knowledge. They are inseparable; neither has meaningful value alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a classroom, there are options to develop the skills of financial literacy, just as you would with welding or baking. Financial literacy skills can be developed with cases and games, with interactive tools and with competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands-on training provides the learner with a feedback loop. They take an action and a consequence develops. Knowledge training without an experiential component is better than nothing, but it cannot compete with experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ideal situation is directly hands on. Games are a great substitute, but not the only option. Case studies, learning from stories and critiquing the actions of others, even simple exercises can add a hands-on component to knowledge training and improve the likelihood of long-term improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge has the singular advantage of being easy to test and evaluate. Assessments can measure knowledge gains whereas skill development is harder to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
Program Elements
&lt;p&gt;Effective financial literacy education needs to develop several skills. Some are overlooked in knowledge-based programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially literate, you need to be able to evaluate financial alternatives. This can be useful in day-to-day activities like comparison shopping and is essential for major purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people should be able to compare mortgage options and make a reasonable choice based on their situation and should be able to evaluate choices like leasing a car versus buying a car. Financial decision-making is an essential financial literacy skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using technology in finance is important and growing in importance. There are fantastic tools available to assist individuals in a myriad of financial challenges. But using powerful tools without knowledge of the consequences can be a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to not only know how to use technology — that’s the easy part — but they also need to know when to use technology and what the potential risks are. It is too easy to invest in risky investments with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can experience negative consequences without even knowing the consequences were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology can be wonderful and powerful, or it can be crippling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud awareness and preventing it needs to be an element of a good financial education. It has been bad out there, and it is getting worse. People need to know how to protect themselves, and where to find out what to watch for as the bad people get better at what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Behavioral Finance
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral finance can no longer be ignored. In school, individuals need to learn about the behavioral aspects of financial literacy and how to deal with the biggest obstacle they will face on their journey to financial success: themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is an emotional topic. Emotions can cause people to make suboptimal decisions. Car dealers know this. You should too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to learn about the risks behavior brings to the table — and how to combat those risks. There must be proactive to solutions to deal with our human tendencies, which do not serve us well as long-term accumulators. The more we understand and are aware of our own shortcomings the greater our ability to overcome them and achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets and volatility are not what holds investors back; behaviors in the face of market conditions and volatility are what holds investors back. Behavioral finance is an essential component of financial literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
Systems Thinking
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy can benefit from systems thinking. Nothing occurs without impacting other things. This is as true in financial matters as it is in any other system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you increase your 401(k) contributions, for example, it impacts not only your retirement preparedness, but also your cash flow and your taxes and may impact other areas of your financial life. Any single change has the potential for multiple consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, financial literacy and financial matters occur within larger systems. An individual’s numeracy skills are a codeterminant of their financial capability. Those with low numeracy skills are more likely to struggle financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numeracy education is not financial education, but supports financial education. Those challenged by numeracy need to gain knowledge of and comfort with other tools to assist with numeracy.&lt;/p&gt;
Talk It to Death
&lt;p&gt;A major aim of basic financial literacy programs is to raise awareness while developing rudimentary skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can help. We can help in our families and we can help in our workplaces. And we can help by simply talking it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can and should talk about financial matters at home. We should talk about budgets and we should talk about the process of evaluating financial alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children who grow up in a home where the parents smoke are more likely to smoke; children who grow up in homes where the parents demonstrate financial awareness and restraint are similarly more likely to pick up these habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t demonstrate the habits you don’t want the kids to pick up, and repeat the habits you would like them to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us can talk up financial literacy at work. We can be advocates for the 401(k) or other retirement plans. We can be advocates for debt reduction and we can be advocates for emergency funds and we can be advocates for budgets. And we can do that without being obnoxious. People don’t like to be told what to do, but they do love stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a passion for financial literacy or financial wellness, you can share that passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be surprised not only by how many people are interested, but also that they will make changes and be excited to tell you of their own progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk it up. Stories are a very powerful teaching tool. Talk it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;There is no silver bullet for financial illiteracy. Amazing things are happening, but we still have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy is a complex skill and we can spend a lifetime continually learning new things. But we won’t if we don’t have a solid start. Financial literacy education needs to build the foundation upon which individuals can build the financial lives they wish to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep the idea of skill or capability as a guiding principle. Knowledge of the difference among investment types is nice but evaluating those differences is essential. The skills can be used in changing situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many tools that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help. There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day. There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy the bigger difference we can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum in which we present may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always enhance financial literacy education in schools by making it experiential. That is what people will most carry forward; that is where the difference is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perusing social media might lead you to believe that frugality is the essence of financial literacy. Not necessarily. Frugal people rarely own airplanes or yachts. The 47 percent of Americans who are financially literate and budget-conscious, according to Harris Insights and Analytics, very well might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frugal people focus on not wasting money — on minimizing their expenses. This can be difficult for low-income households to manage thanks to liquidity restraints, according to a report in the Journal of Marketing Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though those low-income households stand to benefit the most from frugal strategies, such as the ability to buy in bulk, they are unfortunately unable to put those strategies into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people, on the other hand, understand the consequences of their financial decisions and act accordingly. They use financial resources intentionally. Financially literate people focus on making good money decisions. And the best decision often isn’t the most frugal one.&lt;/p&gt;
Living Within Your Means
&lt;p&gt;The common ground between frugality and financial literacy is living within your means. But the two approaches are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of doing well financially, living within one’s means requires that the sum of one’s expenses and savings must be at or below one’s income. This principle transcends both ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially successful, one has to live within one’s means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “means equation” says that we get to spend no more than we make. The frugality camp focuses on minimizing the expenses side of the equation. Unfortunately, neglecting the revenue side can be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
Reducing Expenses vs. Increasing Revenue
&lt;p&gt;It should be fairly apparent that there’s more room to change the revenue side of the equation than the expense side — at least theoretically. Changes to the expense side of the equation are limited to the total of the expenses — you can’t reduce your expenses beyond zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revenue side does not have this barrier. The revenue side is, theoretically, infinitely changeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get Matched With a Financial Adviser Most Suited to Your Unique Needs Maximize Your Retirement Efforts Today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a variety of challenges when it comes to making dramatic increases in the revenue side of the equation. This is especially true in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing one’s income can take a lot of time and hard work. It can also require you to make an intermediate investment, such as getting training or education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, frugality — much like laziness — pays off immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is frugality’s great benefit. Frugality as a tool can help us to navigate times of low income, such as a period of unemployment. Frugality can also help us to push out additional savings to meet a short-term goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually, a frugal lifestyle often burns us out. Living “without” robs us of many simple pleasures. It robs us of the emotional peace of enjoying simple things because it makes us believe that we’re bad for wasting money on ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
Frugality vs. Financial Literacy: The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;In the long term, we need to tell frugality to pound salt. We need to understand that our self-worth is not equal to the number of pennies saved, and we will buy that damn ice cream if we want. Some of those little expenses contribute to self-care, which is important for our mental and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy — making informed and intentional financial decisions — allows us to do what we want, if we’re willing. If we’re willing to understand the ramifications of our decisions, then the sky’s the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the sea’s the limit, depending on whether you picked the airplane or the yacht. It’s all about decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, you can have anything that you’re willing to earn and build for. Or you can spend less and have what’s left over. Frugality is a tool. Financial literacy is the whole tool set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ball is in your court. Choose wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy continues to make slow strides in gaining attention, while discussions of appropriate methodologies in a school setting remain scant. The lack of sufficient attention to methodology has hindered progress; many programs lack meaningful evaluation and longitudinal studies are few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a circular problem: It is difficult to get support to expand programs when there is a lack of verifiable evidence of their effectiveness, which makes it more difficult to move forward and gain that evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A saving grace is the vast need for financial literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and people are visibly getting left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Financial Literacy Mandates
&lt;p&gt;There continues to be slow progress in the number of states requiring some form of personal financial literacy education as a high school graduation requirement. It’s now about half, which is significant, but it is clearly not where we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few states, however, require students to take a stand-alone course in personal finance. More require personal finance education integrated with other coursework. Mandates are great, but they don’t mean that it actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is concerning to see young people graduating high school barely able to read or write; there can be little confidence that they somehow attained reasonable financial literacy education while missing out on reading in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mandates are not always being followed. Schools face many challenges, and states aren’t going to push very hard on getting those who can’t read to be good with money. They probably feel they have bigger problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State financial literacy education mandates in schools are important but not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
The Feedback Challenge
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy education should make a lifetime of difference. All too often results are either not measured or measured at a point in time. And the focus tends to be on knowledge alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is important, but financial literacy is a skill; you need to apply it and use it to develop the skill. You learn skills through practicing with knowledge — both knowledge and experience are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a lot like welding — you can read a bunch of books but that does not make you competent with a torch. You need both knowledge and experience to be a good welder, as you need both knowledge and experience to be competent at any skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t matter if it is baking or flying or financial literacy, knowledge does little without experience, and experience can be an expensive and dangerous teacher in the absence of knowledge. They are inseparable; neither has meaningful value alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a classroom, there are options to develop the skills of financial literacy, just as you would with welding or baking. Financial literacy skills can be developed with cases and games, with interactive tools and with competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands-on training provides the learner with a feedback loop. They take an action and a consequence develops. Knowledge training without an experiential component is better than nothing, but it cannot compete with experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ideal situation is directly hands on. Games are a great substitute, but not the only option. Case studies, learning from stories and critiquing the actions of others, even simple exercises can add a hands-on component to knowledge training and improve the likelihood of long-term improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge has the singular advantage of being easy to test and evaluate. Assessments can measure knowledge gains whereas skill development is harder to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
Program Elements
&lt;p&gt;Effective financial literacy education needs to develop several skills. Some are overlooked in knowledge-based programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially literate, you need to be able to evaluate financial alternatives. This can be useful in day-to-day activities like comparison shopping and is essential for major purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people should be able to compare mortgage options and make a reasonable choice based on their situation and should be able to evaluate choices like leasing a car versus buying a car. Financial decision-making is an essential financial literacy skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using technology in finance is important and growing in importance. There are fantastic tools available to assist individuals in a myriad of financial challenges. But using powerful tools without knowledge of the consequences can be a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to not only know how to use technology — that’s the easy part — but they also need to know when to use technology and what the potential risks are. It is too easy to invest in risky investments with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can experience negative consequences without even knowing the consequences were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology can be wonderful and powerful, or it can be crippling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud awareness and preventing it needs to be an element of a good financial education. It has been bad out there, and it is getting worse. People need to know how to protect themselves, and where to find out what to watch for as the bad people get better at what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Behavioral Finance
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral finance can no longer be ignored. In school, individuals need to learn about the behavioral aspects of financial literacy and how to deal with the biggest obstacle they will face on their journey to financial success: themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is an emotional topic. Emotions can cause people to make suboptimal decisions. Car dealers know this. You should too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to learn about the risks behavior brings to the table — and how to combat those risks. There must be proactive to solutions to deal with our human tendencies, which do not serve us well as long-term accumulators. The more we understand and are aware of our own shortcomings the greater our ability to overcome them and achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets and volatility are not what holds investors back; behaviors in the face of market conditions and volatility are what holds investors back. Behavioral finance is an essential component of financial literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
Systems Thinking
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy can benefit from systems thinking. Nothing occurs without impacting other things. This is as true in financial matters as it is in any other system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you increase your 401(k) contributions, for example, it impacts not only your retirement preparedness, but also your cash flow and your taxes and may impact other areas of your financial life. Any single change has the potential for multiple consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, financial literacy and financial matters occur within larger systems. An individual’s numeracy skills are a codeterminant of their financial capability. Those with low numeracy skills are more likely to struggle financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numeracy education is not financial education, but supports financial education. Those challenged by numeracy need to gain knowledge of and comfort with other tools to assist with numeracy.&lt;/p&gt;
Talk It to Death
&lt;p&gt;A major aim of basic financial literacy programs is to raise awareness while developing rudimentary skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can help. We can help in our families and we can help in our workplaces. And we can help by simply talking it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can and should talk about financial matters at home. We should talk about budgets and we should talk about the process of evaluating financial alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children who grow up in a home where the parents smoke are more likely to smoke; children who grow up in homes where the parents demonstrate financial awareness and restraint are similarly more likely to pick up these habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t demonstrate the habits you don’t want the kids to pick up, and repeat the habits you would like them to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us can talk up financial literacy at work. We can be advocates for the 401(k) or other retirement plans. We can be advocates for debt reduction and we can be advocates for emergency funds and we can be advocates for budgets. And we can do that without being obnoxious. People don’t like to be told what to do, but they do love stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a passion for financial literacy or financial wellness, you can share that passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be surprised not only by how many people are interested, but also that they will make changes and be excited to tell you of their own progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk it up. Stories are a very powerful teaching tool. Talk it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;There is no silver bullet for financial illiteracy. Amazing things are happening, but we still have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy is a complex skill and we can spend a lifetime continually learning new things. But we won’t if we don’t have a solid start. Financial literacy education needs to build the foundation upon which individuals can build the financial lives they wish to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep the idea of skill or capability as a guiding principle. Knowledge of the difference among investment types is nice but evaluating those differences is essential. The skills can be used in changing situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many tools that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help. There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day. There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy the bigger difference we can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum in which we present may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always enhance financial literacy education in schools by making it experiential. That is what people will most carry forward; that is where the difference is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>There are many tools that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help. There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day. There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy the bigger difference we can make.</p>
<p>The forum in which we present may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always enhance financial literacy education in schools by making it experiential. That is what people will most carry forward; that is where the difference is made.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Perusing social media might lead you to believe that frugality is the essence of financial literacy. Not necessarily. Frugal people rarely own airplanes or yachts. The 47 percent of Americans who are financially literate and budget-conscious, according to Harris Insights and Analytics, very well might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frugal people focus on not wasting money — on minimizing their expenses. This can be difficult for low-income households to manage thanks to liquidity restraints, according to a report in the Journal of Marketing Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though those low-income households stand to benefit the most from frugal strategies, such as the ability to buy in bulk, they are unfortunately unable to put those strategies into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people, on the other hand, understand the consequences of their financial decisions and act accordingly. They use financial resources intentionally. Financially literate people focus on making good money decisions. And the best decision often isn’t the most frugal one.&lt;/p&gt;
Living Within Your Means
&lt;p&gt;The common ground between frugality and financial literacy is living within your means. But the two approaches are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of doing well financially, living within one’s means requires that the sum of one’s expenses and savings must be at or below one’s income. This principle transcends both ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially successful, one has to live within one’s means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “means equation” says that we get to spend no more than we make. The frugality camp focuses on minimizing the expenses side of the equation. Unfortunately, neglecting the revenue side can be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
Reducing Expenses vs. Increasing Revenue
&lt;p&gt;It should be fairly apparent that there’s more room to change the revenue side of the equation than the expense side — at least theoretically. Changes to the expense side of the equation are limited to the total of the expenses — you can’t reduce your expenses beyond zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revenue side does not have this barrier. The revenue side is, theoretically, infinitely changeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get Matched With a Financial Adviser Most Suited to Your Unique Needs Maximize Your Retirement Efforts Today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a variety of challenges when it comes to making dramatic increases in the revenue side of the equation. This is especially true in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing one’s income can take a lot of time and hard work. It can also require you to make an intermediate investment, such as getting training or education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, frugality — much like laziness — pays off immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is frugality’s great benefit. Frugality as a tool can help us to navigate times of low income, such as a period of unemployment. Frugality can also help us to push out additional savings to meet a short-term goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually, a frugal lifestyle often burns us out. Living “without” robs us of many simple pleasures. It robs us of the emotional peace of enjoying simple things because it makes us believe that we’re bad for wasting money on ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
Frugality vs. Financial Literacy: The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;In the long term, we need to tell frugality to pound salt. We need to understand that our self-worth is not equal to the number of pennies saved, and we will buy that damn ice cream if we want. Some of those little expenses contribute to self-care, which is important for our mental and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy — making informed and intentional financial decisions — allows us to do what we want, if we’re willing. If we’re willing to understand the ramifications of our decisions, then the sky’s the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the sea’s the limit, depending on whether you picked the airplane or the yacht. It’s all about decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, you can have anything that you’re willing to earn and build for. Or you can spend less and have what’s left over. Frugality is a tool. Financial literacy is the whole tool set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ball is in your court. Choose wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the best business ideas are right in front of you. That was the case for Ashley Clark, who pivoted from being a banker to an entrepreneur and creator of old-school board games and flashcards that teach financial literacy — going against the current trend of online gaming with six-figure success during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade as a banker underscored that too many people didn’t understand their own finances. Clark began to write down common customer questions — using this as her initial “market research.” Next was her tough focus group: her children. Her passion for teaching people about money flourished, and today Clark is CEO and founder of Sense 2 Cents, a financial literacy–based games company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sense 2 Cents aims to take the chore out of learning and foster a solid financial foundation by making the flashcards and board games a family activity, in which parents can learn alongside their children. Clark has also developed active communities on Instagram and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t all smooth sailing: Three months into starting this venture, Clark was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and, being so ill, she understandably wanted to quit. Advice from her entrepreneurial mom helped her stay focused, and now she has tips for those starting their own business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this episode of SheVentures, discover why financial literacy is so important in establishing generational wealth in under-served communities, what financial institutions can do to help, and Clark’s top tips for success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial planning is often pictured in graphic images as an upwardly sloping straight-line path that moves seamlessly from Point A to Point B. People set financial goals, develop a plan, “work the plan” by taking action to reach their goals, and review and revise the plan every so often or when major lifestyle changes occur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this approach can sometimes work well in normal times, the past year has been anything but normal as a result of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many personal financial plans (e.g., jobs, education, moving, travel, retirement dates) “blew up” amid layoffs, lockdowns, deaths of loved ones, and lives fraught with uncertainty. In addition, legislation and the law of supply and demand (i.e., the current U.S. housing market) presented opportunities that nobody could have foreseen, much less planned for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better graphic image for the financial planning process for many people, especially during the past year, is a tangled ball of yarn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five examples are presented, below, of “accidental” financial planning opportunities that were not on most people’s radar screens until recently. They could not have been included in personal financial plans previously because they were not feasible, not applicable, or did not exist under previous tax laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these strategies have arisen in some way, shape, or form as a result of the pandemic and may be useful to consider during the months ahead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Deploy Tax Savings From Unemployment Tax Leniency&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), signed into law on March 12, many taxpayers are exempt from income tax on up to $10,200 of unemployment benefits that were received during 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, this money would be fully taxable as ordinary income (i.e., at a taxpayer’s regular marginal tax rate, like wages, salaries, and tips) on federal tax returns. This tax break was a last-minute addition to the ARPA that few people saw coming and came a month into the 2020 tax filing season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people probably had taxes withheld on their unemployment benefits or sent the IRS quarterly estimated payments in expectation of a future tax liability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the ARPA tax law change, those individuals could now save $1,000 or more on their income taxes (depending on their tax rate and other income sources), resulting in a larger refund or a smaller tax bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, $9,000 in unemployment benefits in the 12 percent tax bracket = $1,080 (9,000 x .12). This is a nice chunk of change to save or repay debt with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Take Tax Credits Available as a Result of Reduced Income&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some taxpayers may qualify for income tax breaks in 2020 for which they previously earned too much income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which maxes out at $15,280 ($21,710) of adjusted gross income (AGI) for a single taxpayer and married couple filing jointly with no children and $41,756 ($47, 646), $47, 440 ($53,330), and $50,594 ($56,844) with one, two, and three or more children, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximum credit amounts on 2020 tax returns for zero, one, two, and three or more children are respectively $538, $3,584, $5,920, and $6,660. A tax credit is a dollar for dollar reduction in tax liability (e.g., $6,000 tentative tax bill minus $3,584 EITC = $2,416 final tax bill). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time ever, perhaps, taxpayers who always earned more than the maximum AGI for the EITC may qualify if they lost income as a result of the pandemic. The tax savings could provide funds for an emergency fund or debt repayment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Use a Big House Profit to Pay Off Accumulated Debt&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some homeowners who lost income and got behind on mortgage payments are cashing out during the current “red hot” housing market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one case that I know of, a home seller who owes over $18,000 in arrearages on a federally backed FHA mortgage and has no money with which to repay it when the foreclosure moratorium expires on June 30 will make about a $60,000 profit as a result of selling the house in a bidding war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After paying back the mortgage arrearage and home selling expenses, the seller will walk away with about $20,000 after less than two years of homeownership and will “punt back” to apartment living until household finances stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Use a Big House Profit and Downsizing to Build a Retirement Nest Egg&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, people who planned to move and downsize anyway and lack sufficient retirement savings can benefit from selling their home in the current sellers’ market and moving to something smaller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They essentially become cash buyers who are better able to compete for new housing in the area where they live or elsewhere. In addition, the spread between their old home’s price and the cost of a new one provides income for future living expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, $300,000 of home sale profit placed in a balanced mutual fund with a 6 percent average return will throw off about $18,000 of annual income.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Increase Savings and Philanthropy&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Americans have experienced financial silver linings that they could have not anticipated as a result of COVID-19: increased income due to demand for their industry sector or work skills and/or reduced expenses such as commuting costs, child care, and other expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like home sale profit and income tax breaks, increased cash flow provides an opportunity for increased savings, debt reduction, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also new opportunities for philanthropy. On 2020 tax returns, married couples filing jointly or singles who do not itemize can deduct $300 in cash contributions to qualified charities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, the tax write-off for couples increases to $600. In addition, the 60 percent of AGI cap on donations made by itemizing taxpayers is suspended in 2021 to encourage philanthropy for coronavirus relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiny homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just saying the name brings to mind images of adorable rolling cottages, cutting-edge lifestyles, and minimal possessions and worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve all seen the TV shows, listened to the podcasts, and fantasized a bit about living in a home in the forest or on a plot of land near a creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those saddled with debt, the idea of a tiny home that costs less than $20,000 sounds like a great idea. Buying a standard house means spending money on a down payment, insurance, interest, and taxes, not to mention maintenance over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The down payment alone is an extreme obstacle to 62 percent of millennials who would not be able to afford a home, according to a survey by Apartment List, while an additional 29 percent claim that the monthly payments would be a severe financial burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This begs the question: Given their low cost, are tiny homes good investments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much does living the “tiny life” actually cost, and what kind of resale value can you expect from owning a tiny house?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
What Are Tiny Homes?
&lt;p&gt;In a few words, the tiny home movement is an effort to combat the prevalence of McMansions. It’s about reducing the size of the space you live in, meaning that many tiny homes are under 500 square feet. They can be made from vans, miniature constructions, or even from storage containers that real estate entrepreneurs like Janelle Briggs provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, there are more than 10,000 tiny homes, according to Go Downsize, and the trend seems to be rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiny-home dwellers may downsize for a variety of reasons — environmental concerns, financial difficulties, or simply for flexibility and freedom. Many tiny homes are mobile, so you can take them wherever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
What Kind of Investment Is a Tiny Home?
&lt;p&gt;One of the things people love most about tiny homes is their endless customizability, which also makes it difficult to answer the question of how much tiny homes cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that they are easily personalized, this makes it difficult to find an average price for tiny homes, as size, materials, and finishes can vary greatly. The figure runs from about $8,000 for a DIY tiny home with minimal fixtures all the way up to $150,000 and beyond for a custom-built tiny home with luxe fittings and features, according to Home Advisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest factors in pricing out a tiny home are materials and labor costs. Anyone who’s worked with a contractor can tell you that those items aren’t cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re willing to do a large portion of the work yourself, you can significantly lower the cost of your home. When looking at a tiny home as an investment, you have to put a dollar value on your own labor. This tells you the real cost, in both money and time spent, of building one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials are the next largest pricing factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re savvy and willing to spend some time researching, you can often find reclaimed materials or leftovers from a job site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are entire stores that sell nothing but the extra parts and slightly damaged fixtures from major building companies. These stores are often local businesses, so a quick Google search should bring up the appropriate place to go depending on your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiny living can be either inexpensive or about the cost of a small starter home. Try finding a $100,000 home with truly top-of-the-line fittings.&lt;/p&gt;

The Cost of Living in a Tiny Home
&lt;p&gt;Living in a tiny home can be incredibly affordable. Heating, cooling, and cleaning 300 square feet is a whole lot cheaper and easier than doing so for a 2,322-square-foot home (the median new home size in 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can reduce your water, power, and other bills even further if you choose to live a sustainability focused lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar panels, well water, and options such as a wood stove for heating can drop your living expenses substantially and shrink your carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other expenses to consider, though, especially if you’re living in a tiny house on wheels and plan to travel. Gas, insurance, and campground fees can add up fast.&lt;/p&gt;
Finding a Place to Live
&lt;p&gt;One thing that you have to take into account when considering the cost and value of tiny living is where you live. Most American cities aren’t tiny-home friendly. Many zoning laws prohibit full-time tiny-home habitation across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you plan to stay in one place, you have to find land that allows tiny homes and has the necessary improvements with water, sewage, and electrical hookups. Many tiny-home dwellers get around this by living on family land or going out into a more rural area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re more sustainably minded, a tiny home is one of the best ways to explore alternative lifestyles. This allows you to disconnect from traditional ways of Western life and see what living off the grid can be like.&lt;/p&gt;
The Resale Market
&lt;p&gt;If you just go by all the reality shows and hype you’d think the tiny home market was absolutely booming. The reality is, well, a tiny bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiny homes are popular, in a big way. But that doesn’t mean that everyone, or even most people, are willing to live in one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask any real estate agent about home renovations, and they’ll advise you to go for broader appeal. Look for the improvements that match the largest portion of the market’s taste and try not to over customize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 56 percent of Americans would consider living in a tiny home, according to a survey by IPX 1031, a Fidelity National financial company. Anything that has such a limited market — or liquidity — is going to be harder to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
Taking Out a Loan
&lt;p&gt;The biggest selling point for tiny homes is that you don’t need to take out a mortgage, according to Hannah Maman, a real estate agent in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won’t find a traditional home loan for a tiny house because most mortgage lenders have minimum loan amounts that are much higher than the one needed for a tiny house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, typical mortgage lenders won’t give out a loan because many tiny houses are on wheels/transportable and not on a foundation, and most lenders require a permanent foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, Maman explains that you can finance directly through a builder or take out either a personal loan or an RV loan. If you are to take out an RV loan for a tiny house, it must first be certified under the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association (to show it’s safe for the road). You can expect to get about 4 to 9 percent interest rates here on a term of 70 to 85 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you aren’t association certified and would rather take out a personal loan, this is doable. It would just be an unsecured personal loan with a higher interest rate, in the 7 to 11 percent range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So many individuals are struggling with debt and are looking for viable alternatives to being locked into a 30-year mortgage,” Maman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even maintenance and utility bills are cut in half, which saves people a ton of money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Maman states, “I think people need to be aware that buying a tiny home, in most cases, isn’t the same as buying a traditional home.” Continue reading below to find out why this kind of investment may not be for you.&lt;/p&gt;

Do Tiny Homes Appreciate in Value?
&lt;p&gt;Best answer: It’s complicated. Traditional wisdom tells us owning a house over a long period of time — say at least five years — can be a good way to grow your money. After all, don’t homes grow in value over time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land that your home sits on may appreciate in value, but the physical house is actually depreciating. The same thing holds true for tiny homes, with the added twist that you don’t usually own any land under them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t expect your tiny home to appreciate in value like a traditional home, advises Noaz Miller, a home-insurance specialist in Scottsdale, Arizona. Location is the key factor that predicts valuation, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Land typically appreciates or depreciates with the local market,” Miller says. Any traditional home with a permanent foundation will have better resale value than a tiny home on wheels, which will depreciate in value like an RV.&lt;/p&gt;
Tiny Homes as Passive Income Investments
&lt;p&gt;If you’re renting out a tiny home, it could be a source of passive income, as is any other rental property. But be aware that there are a host of considerations to consider before becoming a landlord, such as state and local laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A landlord should use a legally reviewed template for their state when creating a lease. States vary in terms of their protections for tenants and landlords, so ensure you protect yourself as much as possible in the event that any tenant falls far enough behind on rent that legal intervention is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One should also take into careful consideration the financial aspects of maintaining the property. Last, be sure to screen your tenants. As problems arise, you will likely be the one responsible for fixing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The Downsides of Tiny Homes
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in living in a tiny home, take care to consider the effects that the size of tiny homes can have on your life. Sure, it would be awesome to travel the world in a tiny home on wheels, but the little rational voice might start screaming, “No! You don’t have a remote job, so you can’t just pick up and go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also may need more than 500 square feet of space. If you ever intend to host friends and have family stay with you, you need more than one bedroom and bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention the difficult regulations that you would have to abide by if you built your own tiny home. Most tiny homes have wheels to avoid the zoning laws in the city, leaving owners scrambling to find a place to park it legally. Some might be able to put it in the backyard of a regular home, but the area must have the proper zoning to accommodate full-time camping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the tiny house has a foundation and isn’t on wheels, it would have to comply with building codes, which usually means it must be a minimum of 700 square feet. For that reason, many people turn to rural areas where land is less expensive to build and park their tiny homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you’re a city person, it may not be practical for you to live out in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;A tiny home can be a great investment for the right person. If you want to build your own house, travel the country with it, and embrace an alternative lifestyle, a tiny home can be an affordable way to accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can customize the home almost endlessly and save money on rent and utilities. It also allows you to take the comforts of home to all kinds of wild and beautiful places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to go tiny with an eye toward reselling your home down the line and realizing gains, you may be disappointed. Tiny homes depreciate and can be difficult to sell, so they might not make good investments in that sense. And if you want to live in a major city, it can be difficult and expensive to find somewhere to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Tiny homes.</p>
<p>Just saying the name brings to mind images of adorable rolling cottages, cutting-edge lifestyles, and minimal possessions and worries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We’ve all seen the TV shows, listened to the podcasts, and fantasized a bit about living in a home in the forest or on a plot of land near a creek.</p>
<p>For those saddled with debt, the idea of a tiny home that costs less than $20,000 sounds like a great idea. Buying a standard house means spending money on a down payment, insurance, interest, and taxes, not to mention maintenance over time.</p>
<p>The down payment alone is an extreme obstacle to 62 percent of millennials who would not be able to afford a home, according to a survey by Apartment List, while an additional 29 percent claim that the monthly payments would be a severe financial burden.</p>
<p>This begs the question: Given their low cost, are tiny homes good investments?</p>

&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to save money on groceries, I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I did stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not a chef, and it’s engineered to give your body everything you need to function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone, and — in theory — should still lead a perfectly normal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing your lifestyle to this extent isn’t as abnormal as you may think. In the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion, according to IBISWorld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Time Is Money
&lt;p&gt;The Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn’t about money — it was about time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think I’m being stingy with my time, but I’m young. Think of all the time I would save by not having to cook. That would effectively add months to my life! I also wouldn’t have to grocery shop very often (never, really). Soylent can be delivered to my door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason I found it so appealing was for health reasons. Stay with me, because I’m about to get pretty holistic about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love automation. Automation means you can set something good in motion and have it run without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can do awesome things without constant motivation. Think automatic bill pay or 401(k) contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Soylent, I’m constantly having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day. That means I’m having to consciously make healthy choices three-plus times per day, so I sometimes don’t eat as healthy as I should. With Soylent, I can be healthy without having to worry about the ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I wouldn’t replace all my meals with Soylent. But many of my boring meals would get replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
Vacation Meals on a Budget
&lt;p&gt;The final reason Soylent caught my eye is the cost. Prices vary based on the amount and whether it’s in bottled or powder form for you to mix, but it’s around $3 per bottle, or $3 per meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though that’s more expensive than most home-cooked meals, it saves a lot of money when traveling or just being out and about. Instead of needing to buy a meal, you can just pull a bottle out of your backpack or purse, and crack it open.&lt;/p&gt;

			Food Hacks That Save Our Readers Time and Money
            &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris: “Purple Carrot delivers a box with three vegan meals to prepare a week. The best part is that it comes with a little cookbook each time. I just buy the ingredients later on if I want to make a recipe again. It got me out of a rut of making me the same stuff…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuart: “I make my own chicken broth from store-bought rotisserie chickens. I hate using fresh onion, carrot or celery just for broth. I developed the habit of taking scraps of the three when I cook and storing them in a container in the freezer. When I need to make broth, I just dump it into my instant pot with my chicken. Saves time and money.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teresa: “Pay attention to how often your favorite products go on sale and stock up on enough to last you until the next cycle. There is a fairly predictable sales cycle.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrick: “Instant Pot. Two magic words.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tonia: “If you have the space, get a big box or upright extra freezer. Make massive batches of dishes like taco meat, slow-cooked pork, pot roast, Indian curry, rice dishes of any kind, etc. Batch them into containers so there’s no cooking during the week. We do this and order in once a week. We keep fresh broccoli, string beans and cauliflower in large Tupperware containers pre-cut and cleaned and quickly pan-fry or steam them in minutes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lisa: “Instacart. Restaurant Depot allows you to order from them to your home since the pandemic started. It’s basically Costco for restaurants.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arindam: “1-800-DIY.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kristen: “HelloFresh has saved me the headache of what to make and shopping for ingredients.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diane: “Make a big batch of pasta sauce or chili on Sunday, freeze some and eat some throughout the week.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
          
The Start of a New Diet
&lt;p&gt;I ordered my first round of Soylent a month ago straight from the website. The package arrived three days later. I opened the box and inside were a dozen white plastic bottles with black caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited to try one until the next day — I wanted to start with an empty stomach so I could get the full effect. That morning, I tried my first sip. It was oddly delicious. I was surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is designed to have a neutral flavor so that the consumer doesn’t get sick of the taste. But still, it was slightly sweet. Soylent subtly smells and tastes of a graham cracker and looks like a light cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;
An Epic Diet Fail
&lt;p&gt;About 20 minutes later, I felt like I had the flu. I ate some “real” food and the flu-like symptoms disappeared. I tried more Soylent the next day. Same reaction. I tried two more times — same reaction again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drank part of one right before doing 45 minutes of a cardio workout to check my energy levels. Exercising with the actual flu would’ve been easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Googled my symptoms. My reaction was very rare. It’s most likely the vanillin flavoring was to blame. And with that, my Soylent diet journey came to an abrupt end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my experience is negative, I still recommend you give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my mom, dad, and cousin to drink Soylent, and they all really enjoyed it. At least they can save time, enjoy better health, and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll continue my quest for a meal replacement beverage. So long, Soylent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Sullivan, director of communication at Soylent, says: “We know many people use our products to save both time and money and are able to do so successfully. However, we do not recommend anyone switching to a Soylent only diet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we always recommend everyone connect with their doctor or dietitian to decide the best overall meal plan to support your personal health goals and nutrition plan,” Sullivan adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentSai does not recommend changing your lifestyle or dietary habits without consulting your physician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Without Soylent, I’m constantly having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day.

<li>Chris: “Purple Carrot delivers a box with three vegan meals to prepare a week. The best part is that it comes with a little cookbook each time. I just buy the ingredients later on if I want to make a recipe again. It got me out of a rut of making me the same stuff…”</li>

The Start of a New Diet
<p>I ordered my first round of Soylent a month ago straight from the website. The package arrived three days later. I opened the box and inside were a dozen white plastic bottles with black caps.</p>
<p>I waited to try one until the next day — I wanted to start with an empty stomach so I could get the full effect. That morning, I tried my first sip. It was oddly delicious. I was surprised.</p>
<p>Soylent is designed to have a neutral flavor so that the consumer doesn’t get sick of the taste. But still, it was slightly sweet. Soylent subtly smells and tastes of a graham cracker and looks like a light cappuccino.</p>
An Epic Diet Fail
<p>About 20 minutes later, I felt like I had the flu. I ate some “real” food and the flu-like symptoms disappeared. I tried more Soylent the next day. Same reaction. I tried two more times — same reaction again.</p>
<p>I drank part of one right before doing 45 minutes of a cardio workout to check my energy levels. Exercising with the actual flu would’ve been easier.</p>
<p>I Googled my symptoms. My reaction was very rare. It’s most likely the vanillin flavoring was to blame. And with that, my Soylent diet journey came to an abrupt end.</p>
<p>Although my experience is negative, I still recommend you give it a try.</p>
<p>I got my mom, dad, and cousin to drink Soylent, and they all really enjoyed it. At least they can save time, enjoy better health, and save money.</p>
<p>I’ll continue my quest for a meal replacement beverage. So long, Soylent.</p>
<p>Jamie Sullivan, director of communication at Soylent, says: “We know many people use our products to save both time and money and are able to do so successfully. However, we do not recommend anyone switching to a Soylent only diet.”</p>
<p>“Additionally, we always recommend everyone connect with their doctor or dietitian to decide the best overall meal plan to support your personal health goals and nutrition plan,” Sullivan adds.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to save money on groceries, I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I did stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not a chef, and it’s engineered to give your body everything you need to function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone, and — in theory — should still lead a perfectly normal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing your lifestyle to this extent isn’t as abnormal as you may think. In the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion, according to IBISWorld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Time Is Money
&lt;p&gt;The Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn’t about money — it was about time.&lt;/p&gt;

]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>80405</guid><title>The Best Methodologies for Teaching Financial Literacy</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy continues to make slow strides in gaining attention, while discussions of appropriate methodologies in a school setting remain scant. The lack of sufficient attention to methodology has hindered progress; many programs lack meaningful evaluation and longitudinal studies are few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a circular problem: It is difficult to get support to expand programs when there is a lack of verifiable evidence of their effectiveness, which makes it more difficult to move forward and gain that evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A saving grace is the vast need for financial literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and people are visibly getting left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Financial Literacy Mandates
&lt;p&gt;There continues to be slow progress in the number of states requiring some form of personal financial literacy education as a high school graduation requirement. It’s now about half, which is significant, but it is clearly not where we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few states, however, require students to take a stand-alone course in personal finance. More require personal finance education integrated with other coursework. Mandates are great, but they don’t mean that it actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is concerning to see young people graduating high school barely able to read or write; there can be little confidence that they somehow attained reasonable financial literacy education while missing out on reading in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mandates are not always being followed. Schools face many challenges, and states aren’t going to push very hard on getting those who can’t read to be good with money. They probably feel they have bigger problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State financial literacy education mandates in schools are important but not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
The Feedback Challenge
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy education should make a lifetime of difference. All too often results are either not measured or measured at a point in time. And the focus tends to be on knowledge alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is important, but financial literacy is a skill; you need to apply it and use it to develop the skill. You learn skills through practicing with knowledge — both knowledge and experience are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a lot like welding — you can read a bunch of books but that does not make you competent with a torch. You need both knowledge and experience to be a good welder, as you need both knowledge and experience to be competent at any skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t matter if it is baking or flying or financial literacy, knowledge does little without experience, and experience can be an expensive and dangerous teacher in the absence of knowledge. They are inseparable; neither has meaningful value alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a classroom, there are options to develop the skills of financial literacy, just as you would with welding or baking. Financial literacy skills can be developed with cases and games, with interactive tools and with competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands-on training provides the learner with a feedback loop. They take an action and a consequence develops. Knowledge training without an experiential component is better than nothing, but it cannot compete with experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ideal situation is directly hands on. Games are a great substitute, but not the only option. Case studies, learning from stories and critiquing the actions of others, even simple exercises can add a hands-on component to knowledge training and improve the likelihood of long-term improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge has the singular advantage of being easy to test and evaluate. Assessments can measure knowledge gains whereas skill development is harder to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
Program Elements
&lt;p&gt;Effective financial literacy education needs to develop several skills. Some are overlooked in knowledge-based programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially literate, you need to be able to evaluate financial alternatives. This can be useful in day-to-day activities like comparison shopping and is essential for major purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people should be able to compare mortgage options and make a reasonable choice based on their situation and should be able to evaluate choices like leasing a car versus buying a car. Financial decision-making is an essential financial literacy skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using technology in finance is important and growing in importance. There are fantastic tools available to assist individuals in a myriad of financial challenges. But using powerful tools without knowledge of the consequences can be a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to not only know how to use technology — that’s the easy part — but they also need to know when to use technology and what the potential risks are. It is too easy to invest in risky investments with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can experience negative consequences without even knowing the consequences were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology can be wonderful and powerful, or it can be crippling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud awareness and preventing it needs to be an element of a good financial education. It has been bad out there, and it is getting worse. People need to know how to protect themselves, and where to find out what to watch for as the bad people get better at what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Behavioral Finance
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral finance can no longer be ignored. In school, individuals need to learn about the behavioral aspects of financial literacy and how to deal with the biggest obstacle they will face on their journey to financial success: themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is an emotional topic. Emotions can cause people to make suboptimal decisions. Car dealers know this. You should too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to learn about the risks behavior brings to the table — and how to combat those risks. There must be proactive to solutions to deal with our human tendencies, which do not serve us well as long-term accumulators. The more we understand and are aware of our own shortcomings the greater our ability to overcome them and achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets and volatility are not what holds investors back; behaviors in the face of market conditions and volatility are what holds investors back. Behavioral finance is an essential component of financial literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
Systems Thinking
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy can benefit from systems thinking. Nothing occurs without impacting other things. This is as true in financial matters as it is in any other system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you increase your 401(k) contributions, for example, it impacts not only your retirement preparedness, but also your cash flow and your taxes and may impact other areas of your financial life. Any single change has the potential for multiple consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, financial literacy and financial matters occur within larger systems. An individual’s numeracy skills are a codeterminant of their financial capability. Those with low numeracy skills are more likely to struggle financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numeracy education is not financial education, but supports financial education. Those challenged by numeracy need to gain knowledge of and comfort with other tools to assist with numeracy.&lt;/p&gt;
Talk It to Death
&lt;p&gt;A major aim of basic financial literacy programs is to raise awareness while developing rudimentary skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can help. We can help in our families and we can help in our workplaces. And we can help by simply talking it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can and should talk about financial matters at home. We should talk about budgets and we should talk about the process of evaluating financial alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children who grow up in a home where the parents smoke are more likely to smoke; children who grow up in homes where the parents demonstrate financial awareness and restraint are similarly more likely to pick up these habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t demonstrate the habits you don’t want the kids to pick up, and repeat the habits you would like them to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us can talk up financial literacy at work. We can be advocates for the 401(k) or other retirement plans. We can be advocates for debt reduction and we can be advocates for emergency funds and we can be advocates for budgets. And we can do that without being obnoxious. People don’t like to be told what to do, but they do love stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a passion for financial literacy or financial wellness, you can share that passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be surprised not only by how many people are interested, but also that they will make changes and be excited to tell you of their own progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk it up. Stories are a very powerful teaching tool. Talk it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;There is no silver bullet for financial illiteracy. Amazing things are happening, but we still have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy is a complex skill and we can spend a lifetime continually learning new things. But we won’t if we don’t have a solid start. Financial literacy education needs to build the foundation upon which individuals can build the financial lives they wish to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep the idea of skill or capability as a guiding principle. Knowledge of the difference among investment types is nice but evaluating those differences is essential. The skills can be used in changing situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many tools that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help. There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day. There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy the bigger difference we can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum in which we present may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always enhance financial literacy education in schools by making it experiential. That is what people will most carry forward; that is where the difference is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>A saving grace is the vast need for financial literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and people are visibly getting left behind.</p>
<p></p>
Financial Literacy Mandates
<p>There continues to be slow progress in the number of states requiring some form of personal financial literacy education as a high school graduation requirement. It’s now about half, which is significant, but it is clearly not where we need to be.</p>
<p>Few states, however, require students to take a stand-alone course in personal finance. More require personal finance education integrated with other coursework. Mandates are great, but they don’t mean that it actually happens.</p>
<p>It is concerning to see young people graduating high school barely able to read or write; there can be little confidence that they somehow attained reasonable financial literacy education while missing out on reading in schools.</p>
<p>The mandates are not always being followed. Schools face many challenges, and states aren’t going to push very hard on getting those who can’t read to be good with money. They probably feel they have bigger problems.</p>
<p>State financial literacy education mandates in schools are important but not sufficient.</p>
The Feedback Challenge
<p>Financial literacy education should make a lifetime of difference. All too often results are either not measured or measured at a point in time. And the focus tends to be on knowledge alone.</p>
<p>Knowledge is important, but financial literacy is a skill; you need to apply it and use it to develop the skill. You learn skills through practicing with knowledge — both knowledge and experience are required.</p>
<p>It is a lot like welding — you can read a bunch of books but that does not make you competent with a torch. You need both knowledge and experience to be a good welder, as you need both knowledge and experience to be competent at any skill.</p>
<p>Doesn’t matter if it is baking or flying or financial literacy, knowledge does little without experience, and experience can be an expensive and dangerous teacher in the absence of knowledge. They are inseparable; neither has meaningful value alone.</p>
<p>Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents</p>
<p>In a classroom, there are options to develop the skills of financial literacy, just as you would with welding or baking. Financial literacy skills can be developed with cases and games, with interactive tools and with competitions.</p>
<p>Hands-on training provides the learner with a feedback loop. They take an action and a consequence develops. Knowledge training without an experiential component is better than nothing, but it cannot compete with experience.</p>
<p>An ideal situation is directly hands on. Games are a great substitute, but not the only option. Case studies, learning from stories and critiquing the actions of others, even simple exercises can add a hands-on component to knowledge training and improve the likelihood of long-term improvement.</p>
<p>Knowledge has the singular advantage of being easy to test and evaluate. Assessments can measure knowledge gains whereas skill development is harder to evaluate.</p>
Program Elements
<p>Effective financial literacy education needs to develop several skills. Some are overlooked in knowledge-based programs.</p>
<p>To be financially literate, you need to be able to evaluate financial alternatives. This can be useful in day-to-day activities like comparison shopping and is essential for major purchases.</p>
<p>Financially literate people should be able to compare mortgage options and make a reasonable choice based on their situation and should be able to evaluate choices like leasing a car versus buying a car. Financial decision-making is an essential financial literacy skill.</p>
<p>Using technology in finance is important and growing in importance. There are fantastic tools available to assist individuals in a myriad of financial challenges. But using powerful tools without knowledge of the consequences can be a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>Students need to not only know how to use technology — that’s the easy part — but they also need to know when to use technology and what the potential risks are. It is too easy to invest in risky investments with technology.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can experience negative consequences without even knowing the consequences were possible.</p>
<p>Technology can be wonderful and powerful, or it can be crippling.</p>
<p>Fraud awareness and preventing it needs to be an element of a good financial education. It has been bad out there, and it is getting worse. People need to know how to protect themselves, and where to find out what to watch for as the bad people get better at what they do.</p>
<p></p>
Behavioral Finance
<p>Behavioral finance can no longer be ignored. In school, individuals need to learn about the behavioral aspects of financial literacy and how to deal with the biggest obstacle they will face on their journey to financial success: themselves.</p>
<p>Money is an emotional topic. Emotions can cause people to make suboptimal decisions. Car dealers know this. You should too.</p>
<p>Students need to learn about the risks behavior brings to the table — and how to combat those risks. There must be proactive to solutions to deal with our human tendencies, which do not serve us well as long-term accumulators. The more we understand and are aware of our own shortcomings the greater our ability to overcome them and achieve success.</p>
<p>Markets and volatility are not what holds investors back; behaviors in the face of market conditions and volatility are what holds investors back. Behavioral finance is an essential component of financial literacy.</p>
Systems Thinking
<p>Financial literacy can benefit from systems thinking. Nothing occurs without impacting other things. This is as true in financial matters as it is in any other system.</p>
<p>If you increase your 401(k) contributions, for example, it impacts not only your retirement preparedness, but also your cash flow and your taxes and may impact other areas of your financial life. Any single change has the potential for multiple consequences.</p>
<p>Likewise, financial literacy and financial matters occur within larger systems. An individual’s numeracy skills are a codeterminant of their financial capability. Those with low numeracy skills are more likely to struggle financially.</p>
<p>Numeracy education is not financial education, but supports financial education. Those challenged by numeracy need to gain knowledge of and comfort with other tools to assist with numeracy.</p>
Talk It to Death
<p>A major aim of basic financial literacy programs is to raise awareness while developing rudimentary skills.</p>
<p>We can help. We can help in our families and we can help in our workplaces. And we can help by simply talking it to death.</p>
<p>We can and should talk about financial matters at home. We should talk about budgets and we should talk about the process of evaluating financial alternatives.</p>
<p>Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents</p>
<p>Children who grow up in a home where the parents smoke are more likely to smoke; children who grow up in homes where the parents demonstrate financial awareness and restraint are similarly more likely to pick up these habits.</p>
<p>Don’t demonstrate the habits you don’t want the kids to pick up, and repeat the habits you would like them to obtain.</p>
<p>Many of us can talk up financial literacy at work. We can be advocates for the 401(k) or other retirement plans. We can be advocates for debt reduction and we can be advocates for emergency funds and we can be advocates for budgets. And we can do that without being obnoxious. People don’t like to be told what to do, but they do love stories.</p>
<p>If you have a passion for financial literacy or financial wellness, you can share that passion.</p>
<p>You may be surprised not only by how many people are interested, but also that they will make changes and be excited to tell you of their own progress.</p>
<p>Talk it up. Stories are a very powerful teaching tool. Talk it to death.</p>
The Bottom Line
<p>There is no silver bullet for financial illiteracy. Amazing things are happening, but we still have a long way to go.</p>
<p>Financial literacy is a complex skill and we can spend a lifetime continually learning new things. But we won’t if we don’t have a solid start. Financial literacy education needs to build the foundation upon which individuals can build the financial lives they wish to have.</p>
<p>We need to keep the idea of skill or capability as a guiding principle. Knowledge of the difference among investment types is nice but evaluating those differences is essential. The skills can be used in changing situations.</p>
<p>There are many tools that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help. There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day. There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy the bigger difference we can make.</p>
<p>The forum in which we present may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always enhance financial literacy education in schools by making it experiential. That is what people will most carry forward; that is where the difference is made.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Perusing social media might lead you to believe that frugality is the essence of financial literacy. Not necessarily. Frugal people rarely own airplanes or yachts. The 47 percent of Americans who are financially literate and budget-conscious, according to Harris Insights and Analytics, very well might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frugal people focus on not wasting money — on minimizing their expenses. This can be difficult for low-income households to manage thanks to liquidity restraints, according to a report in the Journal of Marketing Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though those low-income households stand to benefit the most from frugal strategies, such as the ability to buy in bulk, they are unfortunately unable to put those strategies into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people, on the other hand, understand the consequences of their financial decisions and act accordingly. They use financial resources intentionally. Financially literate people focus on making good money decisions. And the best decision often isn’t the most frugal one.&lt;/p&gt;
Living Within Your Means
&lt;p&gt;The common ground between frugality and financial literacy is living within your means. But the two approaches are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of doing well financially, living within one’s means requires that the sum of one’s expenses and savings must be at or below one’s income. This principle transcends both ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially successful, one has to live within one’s means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “means equation” says that we get to spend no more than we make. The frugality camp focuses on minimizing the expenses side of the equation. Unfortunately, neglecting the revenue side can be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
Reducing Expenses vs. Increasing Revenue
&lt;p&gt;It should be fairly apparent that there’s more room to change the revenue side of the equation than the expense side — at least theoretically. Changes to the expense side of the equation are limited to the total of the expenses — you can’t reduce your expenses beyond zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revenue side does not have this barrier. The revenue side is, theoretically, infinitely changeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get Matched With a Financial Adviser Most Suited to Your Unique Needs Maximize Your Retirement Efforts Today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a variety of challenges when it comes to making dramatic increases in the revenue side of the equation. This is especially true in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing one’s income can take a lot of time and hard work. It can also require you to make an intermediate investment, such as getting training or education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, frugality — much like laziness — pays off immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is frugality’s great benefit. Frugality as a tool can help us to navigate times of low income, such as a period of unemployment. Frugality can also help us to push out additional savings to meet a short-term goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually, a frugal lifestyle often burns us out. Living “without” robs us of many simple pleasures. It robs us of the emotional peace of enjoying simple things because it makes us believe that we’re bad for wasting money on ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
Frugality vs. Financial Literacy: The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;In the long term, we need to tell frugality to pound salt. We need to understand that our self-worth is not equal to the number of pennies saved, and we will buy that damn ice cream if we want. Some of those little expenses contribute to self-care, which is important for our mental and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy — making informed and intentional financial decisions — allows us to do what we want, if we’re willing. If we’re willing to understand the ramifications of our decisions, then the sky’s the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the sea’s the limit, depending on whether you picked the airplane or the yacht. It’s all about decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, you can have anything that you’re willing to earn and build for. Or you can spend less and have what’s left over. Frugality is a tool. Financial literacy is the whole tool set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ball is in your court. Choose wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to save money on groceries, I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I did stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not a chef, and it’s engineered to give your body everything you need to function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone, and — in theory — should still lead a perfectly normal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing your lifestyle to this extent isn’t as abnormal as you may think. In the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion, according to IBISWorld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Time Is Money
&lt;p&gt;The Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn’t about money — it was about time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think I’m being stingy with my time, but I’m young. Think of all the time I would save by not having to cook. That would effectively add months to my life! I also wouldn’t have to grocery shop very often (never, really). Soylent can be delivered to my door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason I found it so appealing was for health reasons. Stay with me, because I’m about to get pretty holistic about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love automation. Automation means you can set something good in motion and have it run without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can do awesome things without constant motivation. Think automatic bill pay or 401(k) contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Soylent, I’m constantly having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day. That means I’m having to consciously make healthy choices three-plus times per day, so I sometimes don’t eat as healthy as I should. With Soylent, I can be healthy without having to worry about the ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I wouldn’t replace all my meals with Soylent. But many of my boring meals would get replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
Vacation Meals on a Budget
&lt;p&gt;The final reason Soylent caught my eye is the cost. Prices vary based on the amount and whether it’s in bottled or powder form for you to mix, but it’s around $3 per bottle, or $3 per meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though that’s more expensive than most home-cooked meals, it saves a lot of money when traveling or just being out and about. Instead of needing to buy a meal, you can just pull a bottle out of your backpack or purse, and crack it open.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris: “Purple Carrot delivers a box with three vegan meals to prepare a week. The best part is that it comes with a little cookbook each time. I just buy the ingredients later on if I want to make a recipe again. It got me out of a rut of making me the same stuff…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuart: “I make my own chicken broth from store-bought rotisserie chickens. I hate using fresh onion, carrot or celery just for broth. I developed the habit of taking scraps of the three when I cook and storing them in a container in the freezer. When I need to make broth, I just dump it into my instant pot with my chicken. Saves time and money.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teresa: “Pay attention to how often your favorite products go on sale and stock up on enough to last you until the next cycle. There is a fairly predictable sales cycle.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrick: “Instant Pot. Two magic words.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tonia: “If you have the space, get a big box or upright extra freezer. Make massive batches of dishes like taco meat, slow-cooked pork, pot roast, Indian curry, rice dishes of any kind, etc. Batch them into containers so there’s no cooking during the week. We do this and order in once a week. We keep fresh broccoli, string beans and cauliflower in large Tupperware containers pre-cut and cleaned and quickly pan-fry or steam them in minutes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lisa: “Instacart. Restaurant Depot allows you to order from them to your home since the pandemic started. It’s basically Costco for restaurants.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arindam: “1-800-DIY.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kristen: “HelloFresh has saved me the headache of what to make and shopping for ingredients.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diane: “Make a big batch of pasta sauce or chili on Sunday, freeze some and eat some throughout the week.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
          
The Start of a New Diet
&lt;p&gt;I ordered my first round of Soylent a month ago straight from the website. The package arrived three days later. I opened the box and inside were a dozen white plastic bottles with black caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited to try one until the next day — I wanted to start with an empty stomach so I could get the full effect. That morning, I tried my first sip. It was oddly delicious. I was surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is designed to have a neutral flavor so that the consumer doesn’t get sick of the taste. But still, it was slightly sweet. Soylent subtly smells and tastes of a graham cracker and looks like a light cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;
An Epic Diet Fail
&lt;p&gt;About 20 minutes later, I felt like I had the flu. I ate some “real” food and the flu-like symptoms disappeared. I tried more Soylent the next day. Same reaction. I tried two more times — same reaction again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drank part of one right before doing 45 minutes of a cardio workout to check my energy levels. Exercising with the actual flu would’ve been easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Googled my symptoms. My reaction was very rare. It’s most likely the vanillin flavoring was to blame. And with that, my Soylent diet journey came to an abrupt end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my experience is negative, I still recommend you give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my mom, dad, and cousin to drink Soylent, and they all really enjoyed it. At least they can save time, enjoy better health, and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll continue my quest for a meal replacement beverage. So long, Soylent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Sullivan, director of communication at Soylent, says: “We know many people use our products to save both time and money and are able to do so successfully. However, we do not recommend anyone switching to a Soylent only diet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we always recommend everyone connect with their doctor or dietitian to decide the best overall meal plan to support your personal health goals and nutrition plan,” Sullivan adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentSai does not recommend changing your lifestyle or dietary habits without consulting your physician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<li>Stuart: “I make my own chicken broth from store-bought rotisserie chickens. I hate using fresh onion, carrot or celery just for broth. I developed the habit of taking scraps of the three when I cook and storing them in a container in the freezer. When I need to make broth, I just dump it into my instant pot with my chicken. Saves time and money.”</li>
<li>Teresa: “Pay attention to how often your favorite products go on sale and stock up on enough to last you until the next cycle. There is a fairly predictable sales cycle.”</li>
<li>Patrick: “Instant Pot. Two magic words.”</li>
<li>Tonia: “If you have the space, get a big box or upright extra freezer. Make massive batches of dishes like taco meat, slow-cooked pork, pot roast, Indian curry, rice dishes of any kind, etc. Batch them into containers so there’s no cooking during the week. We do this and order in once a week. We keep fresh broccoli, string beans and cauliflower in large Tupperware containers pre-cut and cleaned and quickly pan-fry or steam them in minutes.”</li>
<li>Lisa: “Instacart. Restaurant Depot allows you to order from them to your home since the pandemic started. It’s basically Costco for restaurants.”</li>
<li>Arindam: “1-800-DIY.”</li>
<li>Kristen: “HelloFresh has saved me the headache of what to make and shopping for ingredients.”</li>
<li>Diane: “Make a big batch of pasta sauce or chili on Sunday, freeze some and eat some throughout the week.”</li>

The Start of a New Diet
<p>I ordered my first round of Soylent a month ago straight from the website. The package arrived three days later. I opened the box and inside were a dozen white plastic bottles with black caps.</p>
<p>I waited to try one until the next day — I wanted to start with an empty stomach so I could get the full effect. That morning, I tried my first sip. It was oddly delicious. I was surprised.</p>
<p>Soylent is designed to have a neutral flavor so that the consumer doesn’t get sick of the taste. But still, it was slightly sweet. Soylent subtly smells and tastes of a graham cracker and looks like a light cappuccino.</p>
An Epic Diet Fail
<p>About 20 minutes later, I felt like I had the flu. I ate some “real” food and the flu-like symptoms disappeared. I tried more Soylent the next day. Same reaction. I tried two more times — same reaction again.</p>
<p>I drank part of one right before doing 45 minutes of a cardio workout to check my energy levels. Exercising with the actual flu would’ve been easier.</p>
<p>I Googled my symptoms. My reaction was very rare. It’s most likely the vanillin flavoring was to blame. And with that, my Soylent diet journey came to an abrupt end.</p>
<p>Although my experience is negative, I still recommend you give it a try.</p>
<p>I got my mom, dad, and cousin to drink Soylent, and they all really enjoyed it. At least they can save time, enjoy better health, and save money.</p>
<p>I’ll continue my quest for a meal replacement beverage. So long, Soylent.</p>
<p>Jamie Sullivan, director of communication at Soylent, says: “We know many people use our products to save both time and money and are able to do so successfully. However, we do not recommend anyone switching to a Soylent only diet.”</p>
<p>“Additionally, we always recommend everyone connect with their doctor or dietitian to decide the best overall meal plan to support your personal health goals and nutrition plan,” Sullivan adds.</p>
<p>CentSai does not recommend changing your lifestyle or dietary habits without consulting your physician.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy continues to make slow strides in gaining attention, while discussions of appropriate methodologies in a school setting remain scant. The lack of sufficient attention to methodology has hindered progress; many programs lack meaningful evaluation and longitudinal studies are few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a circular problem: It is difficult to get support to expand programs when there is a lack of verifiable evidence of their effectiveness, which makes it more difficult to move forward and gain that evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A saving grace is the vast need for financial literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and people are visibly getting left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Financial Literacy Mandates
&lt;p&gt;There continues to be slow progress in the number of states requiring some form of personal financial literacy education as a high school graduation requirement. It’s now about half, which is significant, but it is clearly not where we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few states, however, require students to take a stand-alone course in personal finance. More require personal finance education integrated with other coursework. Mandates are great, but they don’t mean that it actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is concerning to see young people graduating high school barely able to read or write; there can be little confidence that they somehow attained reasonable financial literacy education while missing out on reading in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mandates are not always being followed. Schools face many challenges, and states aren’t going to push very hard on getting those who can’t read to be good with money. They probably feel they have bigger problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State financial literacy education mandates in schools are important but not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
The Feedback Challenge
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy education should make a lifetime of difference. All too often results are either not measured or measured at a point in time. And the focus tends to be on knowledge alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is important, but financial literacy is a skill; you need to apply it and use it to develop the skill. You learn skills through practicing with knowledge — both knowledge and experience are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a lot like welding — you can read a bunch of books but that does not make you competent with a torch. You need both knowledge and experience to be a good welder, as you need both knowledge and experience to be competent at any skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t matter if it is baking or flying or financial literacy, knowledge does little without experience, and experience can be an expensive and dangerous teacher in the absence of knowledge. They are inseparable; neither has meaningful value alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a classroom, there are options to develop the skills of financial literacy, just as you would with welding or baking. Financial literacy skills can be developed with cases and games, with interactive tools and with competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands-on training provides the learner with a feedback loop. They take an action and a consequence develops. Knowledge training without an experiential component is better than nothing, but it cannot compete with experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ideal situation is directly hands on. Games are a great substitute, but not the only option. Case studies, learning from stories and critiquing the actions of others, even simple exercises can add a hands-on component to knowledge training and improve the likelihood of long-term improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge has the singular advantage of being easy to test and evaluate. Assessments can measure knowledge gains whereas skill development is harder to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
Program Elements
&lt;p&gt;Effective financial literacy education needs to develop several skills. Some are overlooked in knowledge-based programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially literate, you need to be able to evaluate financial alternatives. This can be useful in day-to-day activities like comparison shopping and is essential for major purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people should be able to compare mortgage options and make a reasonable choice based on their situation and should be able to evaluate choices like leasing a car versus buying a car. Financial decision-making is an essential financial literacy skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using technology in finance is important and growing in importance. There are fantastic tools available to assist individuals in a myriad of financial challenges. But using powerful tools without knowledge of the consequences can be a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to not only know how to use technology — that’s the easy part — but they also need to know when to use technology and what the potential risks are. It is too easy to invest in risky investments with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can experience negative consequences without even knowing the consequences were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology can be wonderful and powerful, or it can be crippling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud awareness and preventing it needs to be an element of a good financial education. It has been bad out there, and it is getting worse. People need to know how to protect themselves, and where to find out what to watch for as the bad people get better at what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Behavioral Finance
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral finance can no longer be ignored. In school, individuals need to learn about the behavioral aspects of financial literacy and how to deal with the biggest obstacle they will face on their journey to financial success: themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is an emotional topic. Emotions can cause people to make suboptimal decisions. Car dealers know this. You should too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to learn about the risks behavior brings to the table — and how to combat those risks. There must be proactive to solutions to deal with our human tendencies, which do not serve us well as long-term accumulators. The more we understand and are aware of our own shortcomings the greater our ability to overcome them and achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets and volatility are not what holds investors back; behaviors in the face of market conditions and volatility are what holds investors back. Behavioral finance is an essential component of financial literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
Systems Thinking
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy can benefit from systems thinking. Nothing occurs without impacting other things. This is as true in financial matters as it is in any other system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you increase your 401(k) contributions, for example, it impacts not only your retirement preparedness, but also your cash flow and your taxes and may impact other areas of your financial life. Any single change has the potential for multiple consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, financial literacy and financial matters occur within larger systems. An individual’s numeracy skills are a codeterminant of their financial capability. Those with low numeracy skills are more likely to struggle financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numeracy education is not financial education, but supports financial education. Those challenged by numeracy need to gain knowledge of and comfort with other tools to assist with numeracy.&lt;/p&gt;
Talk It to Death
&lt;p&gt;A major aim of basic financial literacy programs is to raise awareness while developing rudimentary skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can help. We can help in our families and we can help in our workplaces. And we can help by simply talking it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can and should talk about financial matters at home. We should talk about budgets and we should talk about the process of evaluating financial alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children who grow up in a home where the parents smoke are more likely to smoke; children who grow up in homes where the parents demonstrate financial awareness and restraint are similarly more likely to pick up these habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t demonstrate the habits you don’t want the kids to pick up, and repeat the habits you would like them to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us can talk up financial literacy at work. We can be advocates for the 401(k) or other retirement plans. We can be advocates for debt reduction and we can be advocates for emergency funds and we can be advocates for budgets. And we can do that without being obnoxious. People don’t like to be told what to do, but they do love stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a passion for financial literacy or financial wellness, you can share that passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be surprised not only by how many people are interested, but also that they will make changes and be excited to tell you of their own progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk it up. Stories are a very powerful teaching tool. Talk it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;There is no silver bullet for financial illiteracy. Amazing things are happening, but we still have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy is a complex skill and we can spend a lifetime continually learning new things. But we won’t if we don’t have a solid start. Financial literacy education needs to build the foundation upon which individuals can build the financial lives they wish to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep the idea of skill or capability as a guiding principle. Knowledge of the difference among investment types is nice but evaluating those differences is essential. The skills can be used in changing situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many tools that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help. There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day. There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy the bigger difference we can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum in which we present may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always enhance financial literacy education in schools by making it experiential. That is what people will most carry forward; that is where the difference is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perusing social media might lead you to believe that frugality is the essence of financial literacy. Not necessarily. Frugal people rarely own airplanes or yachts. The 47 percent of Americans who are financially literate and budget-conscious, according to Harris Insights and Analytics, very well might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frugal people focus on not wasting money — on minimizing their expenses. This can be difficult for low-income households to manage thanks to liquidity restraints, according to a report in the Journal of Marketing Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though those low-income households stand to benefit the most from frugal strategies, such as the ability to buy in bulk, they are unfortunately unable to put those strategies into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people, on the other hand, understand the consequences of their financial decisions and act accordingly. They use financial resources intentionally. Financially literate people focus on making good money decisions. And the best decision often isn’t the most frugal one.&lt;/p&gt;
Living Within Your Means
&lt;p&gt;The common ground between frugality and financial literacy is living within your means. But the two approaches are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of doing well financially, living within one’s means requires that the sum of one’s expenses and savings must be at or below one’s income. This principle transcends both ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially successful, one has to live within one’s means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “means equation” says that we get to spend no more than we make. The frugality camp focuses on minimizing the expenses side of the equation. Unfortunately, neglecting the revenue side can be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
Reducing Expenses vs. Increasing Revenue
&lt;p&gt;It should be fairly apparent that there’s more room to change the revenue side of the equation than the expense side — at least theoretically. Changes to the expense side of the equation are limited to the total of the expenses — you can’t reduce your expenses beyond zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revenue side does not have this barrier. The revenue side is, theoretically, infinitely changeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get Matched With a Financial Adviser Most Suited to Your Unique Needs Maximize Your Retirement Efforts Today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a variety of challenges when it comes to making dramatic increases in the revenue side of the equation. This is especially true in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing one’s income can take a lot of time and hard work. It can also require you to make an intermediate investment, such as getting training or education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, frugality — much like laziness — pays off immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is frugality’s great benefit. Frugality as a tool can help us to navigate times of low income, such as a period of unemployment. Frugality can also help us to push out additional savings to meet a short-term goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually, a frugal lifestyle often burns us out. Living “without” robs us of many simple pleasures. It robs us of the emotional peace of enjoying simple things because it makes us believe that we’re bad for wasting money on ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
Frugality vs. Financial Literacy: The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;In the long term, we need to tell frugality to pound salt. We need to understand that our self-worth is not equal to the number of pennies saved, and we will buy that damn ice cream if we want. Some of those little expenses contribute to self-care, which is important for our mental and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy — making informed and intentional financial decisions — allows us to do what we want, if we’re willing. If we’re willing to understand the ramifications of our decisions, then the sky’s the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the sea’s the limit, depending on whether you picked the airplane or the yacht. It’s all about decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, you can have anything that you’re willing to earn and build for. Or you can spend less and have what’s left over. Frugality is a tool. Financial literacy is the whole tool set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ball is in your court. Choose wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to save money on groceries, I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I did stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not a chef, and it’s engineered to give your body everything you need to function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone, and — in theory — should still lead a perfectly normal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing your lifestyle to this extent isn’t as abnormal as you may think. In the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion, according to IBISWorld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Time Is Money
&lt;p&gt;The Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn’t about money — it was about time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think I’m being stingy with my time, but I’m young. Think of all the time I would save by not having to cook. That would effectively add months to my life! I also wouldn’t have to grocery shop very often (never, really). Soylent can be delivered to my door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason I found it so appealing was for health reasons. Stay with me, because I’m about to get pretty holistic about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love automation. Automation means you can set something good in motion and have it run without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can do awesome things without constant motivation. Think automatic bill pay or 401(k) contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Soylent, I’m constantly having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day. That means I’m having to consciously make healthy choices three-plus times per day, so I sometimes don’t eat as healthy as I should. With Soylent, I can be healthy without having to worry about the ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I wouldn’t replace all my meals with Soylent. But many of my boring meals would get replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
Vacation Meals on a Budget
&lt;p&gt;The final reason Soylent caught my eye is the cost. Prices vary based on the amount and whether it’s in bottled or powder form for you to mix, but it’s around $3 per bottle, or $3 per meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though that’s more expensive than most home-cooked meals, it saves a lot of money when traveling or just being out and about. Instead of needing to buy a meal, you can just pull a bottle out of your backpack or purse, and crack it open.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris: “Purple Carrot delivers a box with three vegan meals to prepare a week. The best part is that it comes with a little cookbook each time. I just buy the ingredients later on if I want to make a recipe again. It got me out of a rut of making me the same stuff…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuart: “I make my own chicken broth from store-bought rotisserie chickens. I hate using fresh onion, carrot or celery just for broth. I developed the habit of taking scraps of the three when I cook and storing them in a container in the freezer. When I need to make broth, I just dump it into my instant pot with my chicken. Saves time and money.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teresa: “Pay attention to how often your favorite products go on sale and stock up on enough to last you until the next cycle. There is a fairly predictable sales cycle.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrick: “Instant Pot. Two magic words.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tonia: “If you have the space, get a big box or upright extra freezer. Make massive batches of dishes like taco meat, slow-cooked pork, pot roast, Indian curry, rice dishes of any kind, etc. Batch them into containers so there’s no cooking during the week. We do this and order in once a week. We keep fresh broccoli, string beans and cauliflower in large Tupperware containers pre-cut and cleaned and quickly pan-fry or steam them in minutes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lisa: “Instacart. Restaurant Depot allows you to order from them to your home since the pandemic started. It’s basically Costco for restaurants.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arindam: “1-800-DIY.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kristen: “HelloFresh has saved me the headache of what to make and shopping for ingredients.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diane: “Make a big batch of pasta sauce or chili on Sunday, freeze some and eat some throughout the week.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
          
The Start of a New Diet
&lt;p&gt;I ordered my first round of Soylent a month ago straight from the website. The package arrived three days later. I opened the box and inside were a dozen white plastic bottles with black caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited to try one until the next day — I wanted to start with an empty stomach so I could get the full effect. That morning, I tried my first sip. It was oddly delicious. I was surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is designed to have a neutral flavor so that the consumer doesn’t get sick of the taste. But still, it was slightly sweet. Soylent subtly smells and tastes of a graham cracker and looks like a light cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;
An Epic Diet Fail
&lt;p&gt;About 20 minutes later, I felt like I had the flu. I ate some “real” food and the flu-like symptoms disappeared. I tried more Soylent the next day. Same reaction. I tried two more times — same reaction again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drank part of one right before doing 45 minutes of a cardio workout to check my energy levels. Exercising with the actual flu would’ve been easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Googled my symptoms. My reaction was very rare. It’s most likely the vanillin flavoring was to blame. And with that, my Soylent diet journey came to an abrupt end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my experience is negative, I still recommend you give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my mom, dad, and cousin to drink Soylent, and they all really enjoyed it. At least they can save time, enjoy better health, and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll continue my quest for a meal replacement beverage. So long, Soylent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Sullivan, director of communication at Soylent, says: “We know many people use our products to save both time and money and are able to do so successfully. However, we do not recommend anyone switching to a Soylent only diet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we always recommend everyone connect with their doctor or dietitian to decide the best overall meal plan to support your personal health goals and nutrition plan,” Sullivan adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentSai does not recommend changing your lifestyle or dietary habits without consulting your physician.&lt;/p&gt;

]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>80405</guid><title>The Best Methodologies for Teaching Financial Literacy</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy continues to make slow strides in gaining attention, while discussions of appropriate methodologies in a school setting remain scant. The lack of sufficient attention to methodology has hindered progress; many programs lack meaningful evaluation and longitudinal studies are few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a circular problem: It is difficult to get support to expand programs when there is a lack of verifiable evidence of their effectiveness, which makes it more difficult to move forward and gain that evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A saving grace is the vast need for financial literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and people are visibly getting left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Financial Literacy Mandates
&lt;p&gt;There continues to be slow progress in the number of states requiring some form of personal financial literacy education as a high school graduation requirement. It’s now about half, which is significant, but it is clearly not where we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few states, however, require students to take a stand-alone course in personal finance. More require personal finance education integrated with other coursework. Mandates are great, but they don’t mean that it actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is concerning to see young people graduating high school barely able to read or write; there can be little confidence that they somehow attained reasonable financial literacy education while missing out on reading in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mandates are not always being followed. Schools face many challenges, and states aren’t going to push very hard on getting those who can’t read to be good with money. They probably feel they have bigger problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State financial literacy education mandates in schools are important but not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
The Feedback Challenge
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy education should make a lifetime of difference. All too often results are either not measured or measured at a point in time. And the focus tends to be on knowledge alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is important, but financial literacy is a skill; you need to apply it and use it to develop the skill. You learn skills through practicing with knowledge — both knowledge and experience are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a lot like welding — you can read a bunch of books but that does not make you competent with a torch. You need both knowledge and experience to be a good welder, as you need both knowledge and experience to be competent at any skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t matter if it is baking or flying or financial literacy, knowledge does little without experience, and experience can be an expensive and dangerous teacher in the absence of knowledge. They are inseparable; neither has meaningful value alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a classroom, there are options to develop the skills of financial literacy, just as you would with welding or baking. Financial literacy skills can be developed with cases and games, with interactive tools and with competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands-on training provides the learner with a feedback loop. They take an action and a consequence develops. Knowledge training without an experiential component is better than nothing, but it cannot compete with experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ideal situation is directly hands on. Games are a great substitute, but not the only option. Case studies, learning from stories and critiquing the actions of others, even simple exercises can add a hands-on component to knowledge training and improve the likelihood of long-term improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge has the singular advantage of being easy to test and evaluate. Assessments can measure knowledge gains whereas skill development is harder to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
Program Elements
&lt;p&gt;Effective financial literacy education needs to develop several skills. Some are overlooked in knowledge-based programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially literate, you need to be able to evaluate financial alternatives. This can be useful in day-to-day activities like comparison shopping and is essential for major purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people should be able to compare mortgage options and make a reasonable choice based on their situation and should be able to evaluate choices like leasing a car versus buying a car. Financial decision-making is an essential financial literacy skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using technology in finance is important and growing in importance. There are fantastic tools available to assist individuals in a myriad of financial challenges. But using powerful tools without knowledge of the consequences can be a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to not only know how to use technology — that’s the easy part — but they also need to know when to use technology and what the potential risks are. It is too easy to invest in risky investments with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can experience negative consequences without even knowing the consequences were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology can be wonderful and powerful, or it can be crippling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud awareness and preventing it needs to be an element of a good financial education. It has been bad out there, and it is getting worse. People need to know how to protect themselves, and where to find out what to watch for as the bad people get better at what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Behavioral Finance
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral finance can no longer be ignored. In school, individuals need to learn about the behavioral aspects of financial literacy and how to deal with the biggest obstacle they will face on their journey to financial success: themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is an emotional topic. Emotions can cause people to make suboptimal decisions. Car dealers know this. You should too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to learn about the risks behavior brings to the table — and how to combat those risks. There must be proactive to solutions to deal with our human tendencies, which do not serve us well as long-term accumulators. The more we understand and are aware of our own shortcomings the greater our ability to overcome them and achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets and volatility are not what holds investors back; behaviors in the face of market conditions and volatility are what holds investors back. Behavioral finance is an essential component of financial literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
Systems Thinking
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy can benefit from systems thinking. Nothing occurs without impacting other things. This is as true in financial matters as it is in any other system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you increase your 401(k) contributions, for example, it impacts not only your retirement preparedness, but also your cash flow and your taxes and may impact other areas of your financial life. Any single change has the potential for multiple consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, financial literacy and financial matters occur within larger systems. An individual’s numeracy skills are a codeterminant of their financial capability. Those with low numeracy skills are more likely to struggle financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numeracy education is not financial education, but supports financial education. Those challenged by numeracy need to gain knowledge of and comfort with other tools to assist with numeracy.&lt;/p&gt;
Talk It to Death
&lt;p&gt;A major aim of basic financial literacy programs is to raise awareness while developing rudimentary skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can help. We can help in our families and we can help in our workplaces. And we can help by simply talking it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can and should talk about financial matters at home. We should talk about budgets and we should talk about the process of evaluating financial alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children who grow up in a home where the parents smoke are more likely to smoke; children who grow up in homes where the parents demonstrate financial awareness and restraint are similarly more likely to pick up these habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t demonstrate the habits you don’t want the kids to pick up, and repeat the habits you would like them to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us can talk up financial literacy at work. We can be advocates for the 401(k) or other retirement plans. We can be advocates for debt reduction and we can be advocates for emergency funds and we can be advocates for budgets. And we can do that without being obnoxious. People don’t like to be told what to do, but they do love stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a passion for financial literacy or financial wellness, you can share that passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be surprised not only by how many people are interested, but also that they will make changes and be excited to tell you of their own progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk it up. Stories are a very powerful teaching tool. Talk it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;There is no silver bullet for financial illiteracy. Amazing things are happening, but we still have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy is a complex skill and we can spend a lifetime continually learning new things. But we won’t if we don’t have a solid start. Financial literacy education needs to build the foundation upon which individuals can build the financial lives they wish to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep the idea of skill or capability as a guiding principle. Knowledge of the difference among investment types is nice but evaluating those differences is essential. The skills can be used in changing situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many tools that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help. There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day. There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy the bigger difference we can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum in which we present may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always enhance financial literacy education in schools by making it experiential. That is what people will most carry forward; that is where the difference is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>In a classroom, there are options to develop the skills of financial literacy, just as you would with welding or baking. Financial literacy skills can be developed with cases and games, with interactive tools and with competitions.</p>
<p>Hands-on training provides the learner with a feedback loop. They take an action and a consequence develops. Knowledge training without an experiential component is better than nothing, but it cannot compete with experience.</p>
<p>An ideal situation is directly hands on. Games are a great substitute, but not the only option. Case studies, learning from stories and critiquing the actions of others, even simple exercises can add a hands-on component to knowledge training and improve the likelihood of long-term improvement.</p>
<p>Knowledge has the singular advantage of being easy to test and evaluate. Assessments can measure knowledge gains whereas skill development is harder to evaluate.</p>
Program Elements
<p>Effective financial literacy education needs to develop several skills. Some are overlooked in knowledge-based programs.</p>
<p>To be financially literate, you need to be able to evaluate financial alternatives. This can be useful in day-to-day activities like comparison shopping and is essential for major purchases.</p>
<p>Financially literate people should be able to compare mortgage options and make a reasonable choice based on their situation and should be able to evaluate choices like leasing a car versus buying a car. Financial decision-making is an essential financial literacy skill.</p>
<p>Using technology in finance is important and growing in importance. There are fantastic tools available to assist individuals in a myriad of financial challenges. But using powerful tools without knowledge of the consequences can be a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>Students need to not only know how to use technology — that’s the easy part — but they also need to know when to use technology and what the potential risks are. It is too easy to invest in risky investments with technology.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can experience negative consequences without even knowing the consequences were possible.</p>
<p>Technology can be wonderful and powerful, or it can be crippling.</p>
<p>Fraud awareness and preventing it needs to be an element of a good financial education. It has been bad out there, and it is getting worse. People need to know how to protect themselves, and where to find out what to watch for as the bad people get better at what they do.</p>
<p></p>
Behavioral Finance
<p>Behavioral finance can no longer be ignored. In school, individuals need to learn about the behavioral aspects of financial literacy and how to deal with the biggest obstacle they will face on their journey to financial success: themselves.</p>
<p>Money is an emotional topic. Emotions can cause people to make suboptimal decisions. Car dealers know this. You should too.</p>
<p>Students need to learn about the risks behavior brings to the table — and how to combat those risks. There must be proactive to solutions to deal with our human tendencies, which do not serve us well as long-term accumulators. The more we understand and are aware of our own shortcomings the greater our ability to overcome them and achieve success.</p>
<p>Markets and volatility are not what holds investors back; behaviors in the face of market conditions and volatility are what holds investors back. Behavioral finance is an essential component of financial literacy.</p>
Systems Thinking
<p>Financial literacy can benefit from systems thinking. Nothing occurs without impacting other things. This is as true in financial matters as it is in any other system.</p>
<p>If you increase your 401(k) contributions, for example, it impacts not only your retirement preparedness, but also your cash flow and your taxes and may impact other areas of your financial life. Any single change has the potential for multiple consequences.</p>
<p>Likewise, financial literacy and financial matters occur within larger systems. An individual’s numeracy skills are a codeterminant of their financial capability. Those with low numeracy skills are more likely to struggle financially.</p>
<p>Numeracy education is not financial education, but supports financial education. Those challenged by numeracy need to gain knowledge of and comfort with other tools to assist with numeracy.</p>
Talk It to Death
<p>A major aim of basic financial literacy programs is to raise awareness while developing rudimentary skills.</p>
<p>We can help. We can help in our families and we can help in our workplaces. And we can help by simply talking it to death.</p>
<p>We can and should talk about financial matters at home. We should talk about budgets and we should talk about the process of evaluating financial alternatives.</p>
<p>Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents</p>
<p>Children who grow up in a home where the parents smoke are more likely to smoke; children who grow up in homes where the parents demonstrate financial awareness and restraint are similarly more likely to pick up these habits.</p>
<p>Don’t demonstrate the habits you don’t want the kids to pick up, and repeat the habits you would like them to obtain.</p>
<p>Many of us can talk up financial literacy at work. We can be advocates for the 401(k) or other retirement plans. We can be advocates for debt reduction and we can be advocates for emergency funds and we can be advocates for budgets. And we can do that without being obnoxious. People don’t like to be told what to do, but they do love stories.</p>
<p>If you have a passion for financial literacy or financial wellness, you can share that passion.</p>
<p>You may be surprised not only by how many people are interested, but also that they will make changes and be excited to tell you of their own progress.</p>
<p>Talk it up. Stories are a very powerful teaching tool. Talk it to death.</p>
The Bottom Line
<p>There is no silver bullet for financial illiteracy. Amazing things are happening, but we still have a long way to go.</p>
<p>Financial literacy is a complex skill and we can spend a lifetime continually learning new things. But we won’t if we don’t have a solid start. Financial literacy education needs to build the foundation upon which individuals can build the financial lives they wish to have.</p>
<p>We need to keep the idea of skill or capability as a guiding principle. Knowledge of the difference among investment types is nice but evaluating those differences is essential. The skills can be used in changing situations.</p>
<p>There are many tools that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help. There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day. There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy the bigger difference we can make.</p>
<p>The forum in which we present may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always enhance financial literacy education in schools by making it experiential. That is what people will most carry forward; that is where the difference is made.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Perusing social media might lead you to believe that frugality is the essence of financial literacy. Not necessarily. Frugal people rarely own airplanes or yachts. The 47 percent of Americans who are financially literate and budget-conscious, according to Harris Insights and Analytics, very well might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frugal people focus on not wasting money — on minimizing their expenses. This can be difficult for low-income households to manage thanks to liquidity restraints, according to a report in the Journal of Marketing Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though those low-income households stand to benefit the most from frugal strategies, such as the ability to buy in bulk, they are unfortunately unable to put those strategies into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people, on the other hand, understand the consequences of their financial decisions and act accordingly. They use financial resources intentionally. Financially literate people focus on making good money decisions. And the best decision often isn’t the most frugal one.&lt;/p&gt;
Living Within Your Means
&lt;p&gt;The common ground between frugality and financial literacy is living within your means. But the two approaches are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of doing well financially, living within one’s means requires that the sum of one’s expenses and savings must be at or below one’s income. This principle transcends both ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially successful, one has to live within one’s means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “means equation” says that we get to spend no more than we make. The frugality camp focuses on minimizing the expenses side of the equation. Unfortunately, neglecting the revenue side can be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
Reducing Expenses vs. Increasing Revenue
&lt;p&gt;It should be fairly apparent that there’s more room to change the revenue side of the equation than the expense side — at least theoretically. Changes to the expense side of the equation are limited to the total of the expenses — you can’t reduce your expenses beyond zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revenue side does not have this barrier. The revenue side is, theoretically, infinitely changeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get Matched With a Financial Adviser Most Suited to Your Unique Needs Maximize Your Retirement Efforts Today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a variety of challenges when it comes to making dramatic increases in the revenue side of the equation. This is especially true in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing one’s income can take a lot of time and hard work. It can also require you to make an intermediate investment, such as getting training or education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, frugality — much like laziness — pays off immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is frugality’s great benefit. Frugality as a tool can help us to navigate times of low income, such as a period of unemployment. Frugality can also help us to push out additional savings to meet a short-term goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually, a frugal lifestyle often burns us out. Living “without” robs us of many simple pleasures. It robs us of the emotional peace of enjoying simple things because it makes us believe that we’re bad for wasting money on ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
Frugality vs. Financial Literacy: The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;In the long term, we need to tell frugality to pound salt. We need to understand that our self-worth is not equal to the number of pennies saved, and we will buy that damn ice cream if we want. Some of those little expenses contribute to self-care, which is important for our mental and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy — making informed and intentional financial decisions — allows us to do what we want, if we’re willing. If we’re willing to understand the ramifications of our decisions, then the sky’s the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the sea’s the limit, depending on whether you picked the airplane or the yacht. It’s all about decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, you can have anything that you’re willing to earn and build for. Or you can spend less and have what’s left over. Frugality is a tool. Financial literacy is the whole tool set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ball is in your court. Choose wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the best business ideas are right in front of you. That was the case for Ashley Clark, who pivoted from being a banker to an entrepreneur and creator of old-school board games and flashcards that teach financial literacy — going against the current trend of online gaming with six-figure success during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade as a banker underscored that too many people didn’t understand their own finances. Clark began to write down common customer questions — using this as her initial “market research.” Next was her tough focus group: her children. Her passion for teaching people about money flourished, and today Clark is CEO and founder of Sense 2 Cents, a financial literacy–based games company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sense 2 Cents aims to take the chore out of learning and foster a solid financial foundation by making the flashcards and board games a family activity, in which parents can learn alongside their children. Clark has also developed active communities on Instagram and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t all smooth sailing: Three months into starting this venture, Clark was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and, being so ill, she understandably wanted to quit. Advice from her entrepreneurial mom helped her stay focused, and now she has tips for those starting their own business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this episode of SheVentures, discover why financial literacy is so important in establishing generational wealth in under-served communities, what financial institutions can do to help, and Clark’s top tips for success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial planning is often pictured in graphic images as an upwardly sloping straight-line path that moves seamlessly from Point A to Point B. People set financial goals, develop a plan, “work the plan” by taking action to reach their goals, and review and revise the plan every so often or when major lifestyle changes occur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this approach can sometimes work well in normal times, the past year has been anything but normal as a result of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many personal financial plans (e.g., jobs, education, moving, travel, retirement dates) “blew up” amid layoffs, lockdowns, deaths of loved ones, and lives fraught with uncertainty. In addition, legislation and the law of supply and demand (i.e., the current U.S. housing market) presented opportunities that nobody could have foreseen, much less planned for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better graphic image for the financial planning process for many people, especially during the past year, is a tangled ball of yarn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five examples are presented, below, of “accidental” financial planning opportunities that were not on most people’s radar screens until recently. They could not have been included in personal financial plans previously because they were not feasible, not applicable, or did not exist under previous tax laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these strategies have arisen in some way, shape, or form as a result of the pandemic and may be useful to consider during the months ahead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Deploy Tax Savings From Unemployment Tax Leniency&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), signed into law on March 12, many taxpayers are exempt from income tax on up to $10,200 of unemployment benefits that were received during 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, this money would be fully taxable as ordinary income (i.e., at a taxpayer’s regular marginal tax rate, like wages, salaries, and tips) on federal tax returns. This tax break was a last-minute addition to the ARPA that few people saw coming and came a month into the 2020 tax filing season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people probably had taxes withheld on their unemployment benefits or sent the IRS quarterly estimated payments in expectation of a future tax liability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the ARPA tax law change, those individuals could now save $1,000 or more on their income taxes (depending on their tax rate and other income sources), resulting in a larger refund or a smaller tax bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, $9,000 in unemployment benefits in the 12 percent tax bracket = $1,080 (9,000 x .12). This is a nice chunk of change to save or repay debt with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Take Tax Credits Available as a Result of Reduced Income&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some taxpayers may qualify for income tax breaks in 2020 for which they previously earned too much income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which maxes out at $15,280 ($21,710) of adjusted gross income (AGI) for a single taxpayer and married couple filing jointly with no children and $41,756 ($47, 646), $47, 440 ($53,330), and $50,594 ($56,844) with one, two, and three or more children, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximum credit amounts on 2020 tax returns for zero, one, two, and three or more children are respectively $538, $3,584, $5,920, and $6,660. A tax credit is a dollar for dollar reduction in tax liability (e.g., $6,000 tentative tax bill minus $3,584 EITC = $2,416 final tax bill). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time ever, perhaps, taxpayers who always earned more than the maximum AGI for the EITC may qualify if they lost income as a result of the pandemic. The tax savings could provide funds for an emergency fund or debt repayment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Use a Big House Profit to Pay Off Accumulated Debt&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some homeowners who lost income and got behind on mortgage payments are cashing out during the current “red hot” housing market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one case that I know of, a home seller who owes over $18,000 in arrearages on a federally backed FHA mortgage and has no money with which to repay it when the foreclosure moratorium expires on June 30 will make about a $60,000 profit as a result of selling the house in a bidding war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After paying back the mortgage arrearage and home selling expenses, the seller will walk away with about $20,000 after less than two years of homeownership and will “punt back” to apartment living until household finances stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Use a Big House Profit and Downsizing to Build a Retirement Nest Egg&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, people who planned to move and downsize anyway and lack sufficient retirement savings can benefit from selling their home in the current sellers’ market and moving to something smaller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They essentially become cash buyers who are better able to compete for new housing in the area where they live or elsewhere. In addition, the spread between their old home’s price and the cost of a new one provides income for future living expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, $300,000 of home sale profit placed in a balanced mutual fund with a 6 percent average return will throw off about $18,000 of annual income.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Increase Savings and Philanthropy&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Americans have experienced financial silver linings that they could have not anticipated as a result of COVID-19: increased income due to demand for their industry sector or work skills and/or reduced expenses such as commuting costs, child care, and other expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like home sale profit and income tax breaks, increased cash flow provides an opportunity for increased savings, debt reduction, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also new opportunities for philanthropy. On 2020 tax returns, married couples filing jointly or singles who do not itemize can deduct $300 in cash contributions to qualified charities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, the tax write-off for couples increases to $600. In addition, the 60 percent of AGI cap on donations made by itemizing taxpayers is suspended in 2021 to encourage philanthropy for coronavirus relief.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>As a result of the ARPA tax law change, those individuals could now save $1,000 or more on their income taxes (depending on their tax rate and other income sources), resulting in a larger refund or a smaller tax bill. </p>
<p>For example, $9,000 in unemployment benefits in the 12 percent tax bracket = $1,080 (9,000 x .12). This is a nice chunk of change to save or repay debt with.</p>
<b>Take Tax Credits Available as a Result of Reduced Income</b>
<p>Some taxpayers may qualify for income tax breaks in 2020 for which they previously earned too much income. </p>
<p>One example is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which maxes out at $15,280 ($21,710) of adjusted gross income (AGI) for a single taxpayer and married couple filing jointly with no children and $41,756 ($47, 646), $47, 440 ($53,330), and $50,594 ($56,844) with one, two, and three or more children, respectively.</p>
<p>The maximum credit amounts on 2020 tax returns for zero, one, two, and three or more children are respectively $538, $3,584, $5,920, and $6,660. A tax credit is a dollar for dollar reduction in tax liability (e.g., $6,000 tentative tax bill minus $3,584 EITC = $2,416 final tax bill). </p>
<p>For the first time ever, perhaps, taxpayers who always earned more than the maximum AGI for the EITC may qualify if they lost income as a result of the pandemic. The tax savings could provide funds for an emergency fund or debt repayment.</p>
<b>Use a Big House Profit to Pay Off Accumulated Debt</b>
<p>Some homeowners who lost income and got behind on mortgage payments are cashing out during the current “red hot” housing market. </p>
<p>In one case that I know of, a home seller who owes over $18,000 in arrearages on a federally backed FHA mortgage and has no money with which to repay it when the foreclosure moratorium expires on June 30 will make about a $60,000 profit as a result of selling the house in a bidding war. </p>
<p>After paying back the mortgage arrearage and home selling expenses, the seller will walk away with about $20,000 after less than two years of homeownership and will “punt back” to apartment living until household finances stabilize.</p>
<b>Use a Big House Profit and Downsizing to Build a Retirement Nest Egg</b>
<p>Similarly, people who planned to move and downsize anyway and lack sufficient retirement savings can benefit from selling their home in the current sellers’ market and moving to something smaller. </p>
<p>They essentially become cash buyers who are better able to compete for new housing in the area where they live or elsewhere. In addition, the spread between their old home’s price and the cost of a new one provides income for future living expenses. </p>
<p>For example, $300,000 of home sale profit placed in a balanced mutual fund with a 6 percent average return will throw off about $18,000 of annual income.<b> </b></p>
<b>Increase Savings and Philanthropy</b>
<p>Some Americans have experienced financial silver linings that they could have not anticipated as a result of COVID-19: increased income due to demand for their industry sector or work skills and/or reduced expenses such as commuting costs, child care, and other expenses. </p>
<p>Like home sale profit and income tax breaks, increased cash flow provides an opportunity for increased savings, debt reduction, or both.</p>
<p>There are also new opportunities for philanthropy. On 2020 tax returns, married couples filing jointly or singles who do not itemize can deduct $300 in cash contributions to qualified charities. </p>
<p>In 2021, the tax write-off for couples increases to $600. In addition, the 60 percent of AGI cap on donations made by itemizing taxpayers is suspended in 2021 to encourage philanthropy for coronavirus relief.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Tiny homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just saying the name brings to mind images of adorable rolling cottages, cutting-edge lifestyles, and minimal possessions and worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve all seen the TV shows, listened to the podcasts, and fantasized a bit about living in a home in the forest or on a plot of land near a creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those saddled with debt, the idea of a tiny home that costs less than $20,000 sounds like a great idea. Buying a standard house means spending money on a down payment, insurance, interest, and taxes, not to mention maintenance over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The down payment alone is an extreme obstacle to 62 percent of millennials who would not be able to afford a home, according to a survey by Apartment List, while an additional 29 percent claim that the monthly payments would be a severe financial burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This begs the question: Given their low cost, are tiny homes good investments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much does living the “tiny life” actually cost, and what kind of resale value can you expect from owning a tiny house?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
What Are Tiny Homes?
&lt;p&gt;In a few words, the tiny home movement is an effort to combat the prevalence of McMansions. It’s about reducing the size of the space you live in, meaning that many tiny homes are under 500 square feet. They can be made from vans, miniature constructions, or even from storage containers that real estate entrepreneurs like Janelle Briggs provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, there are more than 10,000 tiny homes, according to Go Downsize, and the trend seems to be rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiny-home dwellers may downsize for a variety of reasons — environmental concerns, financial difficulties, or simply for flexibility and freedom. Many tiny homes are mobile, so you can take them wherever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
What Kind of Investment Is a Tiny Home?
&lt;p&gt;One of the things people love most about tiny homes is their endless customizability, which also makes it difficult to answer the question of how much tiny homes cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that they are easily personalized, this makes it difficult to find an average price for tiny homes, as size, materials, and finishes can vary greatly. The figure runs from about $8,000 for a DIY tiny home with minimal fixtures all the way up to $150,000 and beyond for a custom-built tiny home with luxe fittings and features, according to Home Advisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest factors in pricing out a tiny home are materials and labor costs. Anyone who’s worked with a contractor can tell you that those items aren’t cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re willing to do a large portion of the work yourself, you can significantly lower the cost of your home. When looking at a tiny home as an investment, you have to put a dollar value on your own labor. This tells you the real cost, in both money and time spent, of building one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials are the next largest pricing factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re savvy and willing to spend some time researching, you can often find reclaimed materials or leftovers from a job site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are entire stores that sell nothing but the extra parts and slightly damaged fixtures from major building companies. These stores are often local businesses, so a quick Google search should bring up the appropriate place to go depending on your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiny living can be either inexpensive or about the cost of a small starter home. Try finding a $100,000 home with truly top-of-the-line fittings.&lt;/p&gt;

The Cost of Living in a Tiny Home
&lt;p&gt;Living in a tiny home can be incredibly affordable. Heating, cooling, and cleaning 300 square feet is a whole lot cheaper and easier than doing so for a 2,322-square-foot home (the median new home size in 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can reduce your water, power, and other bills even further if you choose to live a sustainability focused lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar panels, well water, and options such as a wood stove for heating can drop your living expenses substantially and shrink your carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other expenses to consider, though, especially if you’re living in a tiny house on wheels and plan to travel. Gas, insurance, and campground fees can add up fast.&lt;/p&gt;
Finding a Place to Live
&lt;p&gt;One thing that you have to take into account when considering the cost and value of tiny living is where you live. Most American cities aren’t tiny-home friendly. Many zoning laws prohibit full-time tiny-home habitation across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you plan to stay in one place, you have to find land that allows tiny homes and has the necessary improvements with water, sewage, and electrical hookups. Many tiny-home dwellers get around this by living on family land or going out into a more rural area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re more sustainably minded, a tiny home is one of the best ways to explore alternative lifestyles. This allows you to disconnect from traditional ways of Western life and see what living off the grid can be like.&lt;/p&gt;
The Resale Market
&lt;p&gt;If you just go by all the reality shows and hype you’d think the tiny home market was absolutely booming. The reality is, well, a tiny bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiny homes are popular, in a big way. But that doesn’t mean that everyone, or even most people, are willing to live in one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask any real estate agent about home renovations, and they’ll advise you to go for broader appeal. Look for the improvements that match the largest portion of the market’s taste and try not to over customize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 56 percent of Americans would consider living in a tiny home, according to a survey by IPX 1031, a Fidelity National financial company. Anything that has such a limited market — or liquidity — is going to be harder to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
Taking Out a Loan
&lt;p&gt;The biggest selling point for tiny homes is that you don’t need to take out a mortgage, according to Hannah Maman, a real estate agent in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won’t find a traditional home loan for a tiny house because most mortgage lenders have minimum loan amounts that are much higher than the one needed for a tiny house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, typical mortgage lenders won’t give out a loan because many tiny houses are on wheels/transportable and not on a foundation, and most lenders require a permanent foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, Maman explains that you can finance directly through a builder or take out either a personal loan or an RV loan. If you are to take out an RV loan for a tiny house, it must first be certified under the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association (to show it’s safe for the road). You can expect to get about 4 to 9 percent interest rates here on a term of 70 to 85 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you aren’t association certified and would rather take out a personal loan, this is doable. It would just be an unsecured personal loan with a higher interest rate, in the 7 to 11 percent range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So many individuals are struggling with debt and are looking for viable alternatives to being locked into a 30-year mortgage,” Maman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even maintenance and utility bills are cut in half, which saves people a ton of money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Maman states, “I think people need to be aware that buying a tiny home, in most cases, isn’t the same as buying a traditional home.” Continue reading below to find out why this kind of investment may not be for you.&lt;/p&gt;

Do Tiny Homes Appreciate in Value?
&lt;p&gt;Best answer: It’s complicated. Traditional wisdom tells us owning a house over a long period of time — say at least five years — can be a good way to grow your money. After all, don’t homes grow in value over time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land that your home sits on may appreciate in value, but the physical house is actually depreciating. The same thing holds true for tiny homes, with the added twist that you don’t usually own any land under them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t expect your tiny home to appreciate in value like a traditional home, advises Noaz Miller, a home-insurance specialist in Scottsdale, Arizona. Location is the key factor that predicts valuation, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Land typically appreciates or depreciates with the local market,” Miller says. Any traditional home with a permanent foundation will have better resale value than a tiny home on wheels, which will depreciate in value like an RV.&lt;/p&gt;
Tiny Homes as Passive Income Investments
&lt;p&gt;If you’re renting out a tiny home, it could be a source of passive income, as is any other rental property. But be aware that there are a host of considerations to consider before becoming a landlord, such as state and local laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A landlord should use a legally reviewed template for their state when creating a lease. States vary in terms of their protections for tenants and landlords, so ensure you protect yourself as much as possible in the event that any tenant falls far enough behind on rent that legal intervention is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One should also take into careful consideration the financial aspects of maintaining the property. Last, be sure to screen your tenants. As problems arise, you will likely be the one responsible for fixing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The Downsides of Tiny Homes
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in living in a tiny home, take care to consider the effects that the size of tiny homes can have on your life. Sure, it would be awesome to travel the world in a tiny home on wheels, but the little rational voice might start screaming, “No! You don’t have a remote job, so you can’t just pick up and go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also may need more than 500 square feet of space. If you ever intend to host friends and have family stay with you, you need more than one bedroom and bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention the difficult regulations that you would have to abide by if you built your own tiny home. Most tiny homes have wheels to avoid the zoning laws in the city, leaving owners scrambling to find a place to park it legally. Some might be able to put it in the backyard of a regular home, but the area must have the proper zoning to accommodate full-time camping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the tiny house has a foundation and isn’t on wheels, it would have to comply with building codes, which usually means it must be a minimum of 700 square feet. For that reason, many people turn to rural areas where land is less expensive to build and park their tiny homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you’re a city person, it may not be practical for you to live out in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;A tiny home can be a great investment for the right person. If you want to build your own house, travel the country with it, and embrace an alternative lifestyle, a tiny home can be an affordable way to accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can customize the home almost endlessly and save money on rent and utilities. It also allows you to take the comforts of home to all kinds of wild and beautiful places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to go tiny with an eye toward reselling your home down the line and realizing gains, you may be disappointed. Tiny homes depreciate and can be difficult to sell, so they might not make good investments in that sense. And if you want to live in a major city, it can be difficult and expensive to find somewhere to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to save money on groceries, I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I did stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not a chef, and it’s engineered to give your body everything you need to function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone, and — in theory — should still lead a perfectly normal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing your lifestyle to this extent isn’t as abnormal as you may think. In the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion, according to IBISWorld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Time Is Money
&lt;p&gt;The Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn’t about money — it was about time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think I’m being stingy with my time, but I’m young. Think of all the time I would save by not having to cook. That would effectively add months to my life! I also wouldn’t have to grocery shop very often (never, really). Soylent can be delivered to my door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason I found it so appealing was for health reasons. Stay with me, because I’m about to get pretty holistic about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love automation. Automation means you can set something good in motion and have it run without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can do awesome things without constant motivation. Think automatic bill pay or 401(k) contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Soylent, I’m constantly having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day. That means I’m having to consciously make healthy choices three-plus times per day, so I sometimes don’t eat as healthy as I should. With Soylent, I can be healthy without having to worry about the ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I wouldn’t replace all my meals with Soylent. But many of my boring meals would get replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
Vacation Meals on a Budget
&lt;p&gt;The final reason Soylent caught my eye is the cost. Prices vary based on the amount and whether it’s in bottled or powder form for you to mix, but it’s around $3 per bottle, or $3 per meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though that’s more expensive than most home-cooked meals, it saves a lot of money when traveling or just being out and about. Instead of needing to buy a meal, you can just pull a bottle out of your backpack or purse, and crack it open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Chris: “Purple Carrot delivers a box with three vegan meals to prepare a week. The best part is that it comes with a little cookbook each time. I just buy the ingredients later on if I want to make a recipe again. It got me out of a rut of making me the same stuff…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuart: “I make my own chicken broth from store-bought rotisserie chickens. I hate using fresh onion, carrot or celery just for broth. I developed the habit of taking scraps of the three when I cook and storing them in a container in the freezer. When I need to make broth, I just dump it into my instant pot with my chicken. Saves time and money.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teresa: “Pay attention to how often your favorite products go on sale and stock up on enough to last you until the next cycle. There is a fairly predictable sales cycle.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrick: “Instant Pot. Two magic words.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tonia: “If you have the space, get a big box or upright extra freezer. Make massive batches of dishes like taco meat, slow-cooked pork, pot roast, Indian curry, rice dishes of any kind, etc. Batch them into containers so there’s no cooking during the week. We do this and order in once a week. We keep fresh broccoli, string beans and cauliflower in large Tupperware containers pre-cut and cleaned and quickly pan-fry or steam them in minutes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lisa: “Instacart. Restaurant Depot allows you to order from them to your home since the pandemic started. It’s basically Costco for restaurants.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arindam: “1-800-DIY.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kristen: “HelloFresh has saved me the headache of what to make and shopping for ingredients.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diane: “Make a big batch of pasta sauce or chili on Sunday, freeze some and eat some throughout the week.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
          
The Start of a New Diet
&lt;p&gt;I ordered my first round of Soylent a month ago straight from the website. The package arrived three days later. I opened the box and inside were a dozen white plastic bottles with black caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited to try one until the next day — I wanted to start with an empty stomach so I could get the full effect. That morning, I tried my first sip. It was oddly delicious. I was surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is designed to have a neutral flavor so that the consumer doesn’t get sick of the taste. But still, it was slightly sweet. Soylent subtly smells and tastes of a graham cracker and looks like a light cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;
An Epic Diet Fail
&lt;p&gt;About 20 minutes later, I felt like I had the flu. I ate some “real” food and the flu-like symptoms disappeared. I tried more Soylent the next day. Same reaction. I tried two more times — same reaction again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drank part of one right before doing 45 minutes of a cardio workout to check my energy levels. Exercising with the actual flu would’ve been easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Googled my symptoms. My reaction was very rare. It’s most likely the vanillin flavoring was to blame. And with that, my Soylent diet journey came to an abrupt end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my experience is negative, I still recommend you give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my mom, dad, and cousin to drink Soylent, and they all really enjoyed it. At least they can save time, enjoy better health, and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll continue my quest for a meal replacement beverage. So long, Soylent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Sullivan, director of communication at Soylent, says: “We know many people use our products to save both time and money and are able to do so successfully. However, we do not recommend anyone switching to a Soylent only diet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we always recommend everyone connect with their doctor or dietitian to decide the best overall meal plan to support your personal health goals and nutrition plan,” Sullivan adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentSai does not recommend changing your lifestyle or dietary habits without consulting your physician.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Instead of trying to save money on groceries, I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I did stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.</p>
<p>Soylent is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not a chef, and it’s engineered to give your body everything you need to function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone, and — in theory — should still lead a perfectly normal life.</p>
<p>Changing your lifestyle to this extent isn’t as abnormal as you may think. In the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion, according to IBISWorld.</p>
<p></p>
Time Is Money
<p>The Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn’t about money — it was about time.</p>
<p>You may think I’m being stingy with my time, but I’m young. Think of all the time I would save by not having to cook. That would effectively add months to my life! I also wouldn’t have to grocery shop very often (never, really). Soylent can be delivered to my door.</p>
<p>The second reason I found it so appealing was for health reasons. Stay with me, because I’m about to get pretty holistic about life.</p>
<p>I love automation. Automation means you can set something good in motion and have it run without you.</p>
<p>This means you can do awesome things without constant motivation. Think automatic bill pay or 401(k) contributions.</p>
<p>Without Soylent, I’m constantly having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day. That means I’m having to consciously make healthy choices three-plus times per day, so I sometimes don’t eat as healthy as I should. With Soylent, I can be healthy without having to worry about the ingredients.</p>
<p>Of course, I wouldn’t replace all my meals with Soylent. But many of my boring meals would get replaced.</p>
Vacation Meals on a Budget
<p>The final reason Soylent caught my eye is the cost. Prices vary based on the amount and whether it’s in bottled or powder form for you to mix, but it’s around $3 per bottle, or $3 per meal.</p>
<p>Though that’s more expensive than most home-cooked meals, it saves a lot of money when traveling or just being out and about. Instead of needing to buy a meal, you can just pull a bottle out of your backpack or purse, and crack it open.</p>

]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>80405</guid><title>The Best Methodologies for Teaching Financial Literacy</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy continues to make slow strides in gaining attention, while discussions of appropriate methodologies in a school setting remain scant. The lack of sufficient attention to methodology has hindered progress; many programs lack meaningful evaluation and longitudinal studies are few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a circular problem: It is difficult to get support to expand programs when there is a lack of verifiable evidence of their effectiveness, which makes it more difficult to move forward and gain that evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A saving grace is the vast need for financial literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and people are visibly getting left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Financial Literacy Mandates
&lt;p&gt;There continues to be slow progress in the number of states requiring some form of personal financial literacy education as a high school graduation requirement. It’s now about half, which is significant, but it is clearly not where we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few states, however, require students to take a stand-alone course in personal finance. More require personal finance education integrated with other coursework. Mandates are great, but they don’t mean that it actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is concerning to see young people graduating high school barely able to read or write; there can be little confidence that they somehow attained reasonable financial literacy education while missing out on reading in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mandates are not always being followed. Schools face many challenges, and states aren’t going to push very hard on getting those who can’t read to be good with money. They probably feel they have bigger problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State financial literacy education mandates in schools are important but not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
The Feedback Challenge
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy education should make a lifetime of difference. All too often results are either not measured or measured at a point in time. And the focus tends to be on knowledge alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is important, but financial literacy is a skill; you need to apply it and use it to develop the skill. You learn skills through practicing with knowledge — both knowledge and experience are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a lot like welding — you can read a bunch of books but that does not make you competent with a torch. You need both knowledge and experience to be a good welder, as you need both knowledge and experience to be competent at any skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t matter if it is baking or flying or financial literacy, knowledge does little without experience, and experience can be an expensive and dangerous teacher in the absence of knowledge. They are inseparable; neither has meaningful value alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a classroom, there are options to develop the skills of financial literacy, just as you would with welding or baking. Financial literacy skills can be developed with cases and games, with interactive tools and with competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands-on training provides the learner with a feedback loop. They take an action and a consequence develops. Knowledge training without an experiential component is better than nothing, but it cannot compete with experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ideal situation is directly hands on. Games are a great substitute, but not the only option. Case studies, learning from stories and critiquing the actions of others, even simple exercises can add a hands-on component to knowledge training and improve the likelihood of long-term improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge has the singular advantage of being easy to test and evaluate. Assessments can measure knowledge gains whereas skill development is harder to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
Program Elements
&lt;p&gt;Effective financial literacy education needs to develop several skills. Some are overlooked in knowledge-based programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially literate, you need to be able to evaluate financial alternatives. This can be useful in day-to-day activities like comparison shopping and is essential for major purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people should be able to compare mortgage options and make a reasonable choice based on their situation and should be able to evaluate choices like leasing a car versus buying a car. Financial decision-making is an essential financial literacy skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using technology in finance is important and growing in importance. There are fantastic tools available to assist individuals in a myriad of financial challenges. But using powerful tools without knowledge of the consequences can be a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to not only know how to use technology — that’s the easy part — but they also need to know when to use technology and what the potential risks are. It is too easy to invest in risky investments with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can experience negative consequences without even knowing the consequences were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology can be wonderful and powerful, or it can be crippling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud awareness and preventing it needs to be an element of a good financial education. It has been bad out there, and it is getting worse. People need to know how to protect themselves, and where to find out what to watch for as the bad people get better at what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Behavioral Finance
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral finance can no longer be ignored. In school, individuals need to learn about the behavioral aspects of financial literacy and how to deal with the biggest obstacle they will face on their journey to financial success: themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is an emotional topic. Emotions can cause people to make suboptimal decisions. Car dealers know this. You should too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to learn about the risks behavior brings to the table — and how to combat those risks. There must be proactive to solutions to deal with our human tendencies, which do not serve us well as long-term accumulators. The more we understand and are aware of our own shortcomings the greater our ability to overcome them and achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets and volatility are not what holds investors back; behaviors in the face of market conditions and volatility are what holds investors back. Behavioral finance is an essential component of financial literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
Systems Thinking
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy can benefit from systems thinking. Nothing occurs without impacting other things. This is as true in financial matters as it is in any other system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you increase your 401(k) contributions, for example, it impacts not only your retirement preparedness, but also your cash flow and your taxes and may impact other areas of your financial life. Any single change has the potential for multiple consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, financial literacy and financial matters occur within larger systems. An individual’s numeracy skills are a codeterminant of their financial capability. Those with low numeracy skills are more likely to struggle financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numeracy education is not financial education, but supports financial education. Those challenged by numeracy need to gain knowledge of and comfort with other tools to assist with numeracy.&lt;/p&gt;
Talk It to Death
&lt;p&gt;A major aim of basic financial literacy programs is to raise awareness while developing rudimentary skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can help. We can help in our families and we can help in our workplaces. And we can help by simply talking it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can and should talk about financial matters at home. We should talk about budgets and we should talk about the process of evaluating financial alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children who grow up in a home where the parents smoke are more likely to smoke; children who grow up in homes where the parents demonstrate financial awareness and restraint are similarly more likely to pick up these habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t demonstrate the habits you don’t want the kids to pick up, and repeat the habits you would like them to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us can talk up financial literacy at work. We can be advocates for the 401(k) or other retirement plans. We can be advocates for debt reduction and we can be advocates for emergency funds and we can be advocates for budgets. And we can do that without being obnoxious. People don’t like to be told what to do, but they do love stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a passion for financial literacy or financial wellness, you can share that passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be surprised not only by how many people are interested, but also that they will make changes and be excited to tell you of their own progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk it up. Stories are a very powerful teaching tool. Talk it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;There is no silver bullet for financial illiteracy. Amazing things are happening, but we still have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy is a complex skill and we can spend a lifetime continually learning new things. But we won’t if we don’t have a solid start. Financial literacy education needs to build the foundation upon which individuals can build the financial lives they wish to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep the idea of skill or capability as a guiding principle. Knowledge of the difference among investment types is nice but evaluating those differences is essential. The skills can be used in changing situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many tools that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help. There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day. There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy the bigger difference we can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum in which we present may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always enhance financial literacy education in schools by making it experiential. That is what people will most carry forward; that is where the difference is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Financial literacy continues to make slow strides in gaining attention, while discussions of appropriate methodologies in a school setting remain scant. The lack of sufficient attention to methodology has hindered progress; many programs lack meaningful evaluation and longitudinal studies are few.</p>
<p>This creates a circular problem: It is difficult to get support to expand programs when there is a lack of verifiable evidence of their effectiveness, which makes it more difficult to move forward and gain that evidence.</p>
<p>A saving grace is the vast need for financial literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and people are visibly getting left behind.</p>
<p></p>
Financial Literacy Mandates
<p>There continues to be slow progress in the number of states requiring some form of personal financial literacy education as a high school graduation requirement. It’s now about half, which is significant, but it is clearly not where we need to be.</p>
<p>Few states, however, require students to take a stand-alone course in personal finance. More require personal finance education integrated with other coursework. Mandates are great, but they don’t mean that it actually happens.</p>
<p>It is concerning to see young people graduating high school barely able to read or write; there can be little confidence that they somehow attained reasonable financial literacy education while missing out on reading in schools.</p>
<p>The mandates are not always being followed. Schools face many challenges, and states aren’t going to push very hard on getting those who can’t read to be good with money. They probably feel they have bigger problems.</p>
<p>State financial literacy education mandates in schools are important but not sufficient.</p>
The Feedback Challenge
<p>Financial literacy education should make a lifetime of difference. All too often results are either not measured or measured at a point in time. And the focus tends to be on knowledge alone.</p>
<p>Knowledge is important, but financial literacy is a skill; you need to apply it and use it to develop the skill. You learn skills through practicing with knowledge — both knowledge and experience are required.</p>
<p>It is a lot like welding — you can read a bunch of books but that does not make you competent with a torch. You need both knowledge and experience to be a good welder, as you need both knowledge and experience to be competent at any skill.</p>
<p>Doesn’t matter if it is baking or flying or financial literacy, knowledge does little without experience, and experience can be an expensive and dangerous teacher in the absence of knowledge. They are inseparable; neither has meaningful value alone.</p>
<p>Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents</p>
<p>In a classroom, there are options to develop the skills of financial literacy, just as you would with welding or baking. Financial literacy skills can be developed with cases and games, with interactive tools and with competitions.</p>
<p>Hands-on training provides the learner with a feedback loop. They take an action and a consequence develops. Knowledge training without an experiential component is better than nothing, but it cannot compete with experience.</p>
<p>An ideal situation is directly hands on. Games are a great substitute, but not the only option. Case studies, learning from stories and critiquing the actions of others, even simple exercises can add a hands-on component to knowledge training and improve the likelihood of long-term improvement.</p>
<p>Knowledge has the singular advantage of being easy to test and evaluate. Assessments can measure knowledge gains whereas skill development is harder to evaluate.</p>
Program Elements
<p>Effective financial literacy education needs to develop several skills. Some are overlooked in knowledge-based programs.</p>
<p>To be financially literate, you need to be able to evaluate financial alternatives. This can be useful in day-to-day activities like comparison shopping and is essential for major purchases.</p>
<p>Financially literate people should be able to compare mortgage options and make a reasonable choice based on their situation and should be able to evaluate choices like leasing a car versus buying a car. Financial decision-making is an essential financial literacy skill.</p>
<p>Using technology in finance is important and growing in importance. There are fantastic tools available to assist individuals in a myriad of financial challenges. But using powerful tools without knowledge of the consequences can be a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>Students need to not only know how to use technology — that’s the easy part — but they also need to know when to use technology and what the potential risks are. It is too easy to invest in risky investments with technology.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can experience negative consequences without even knowing the consequences were possible.</p>
<p>Technology can be wonderful and powerful, or it can be crippling.</p>
<p>Fraud awareness and preventing it needs to be an element of a good financial education. It has been bad out there, and it is getting worse. People need to know how to protect themselves, and where to find out what to watch for as the bad people get better at what they do.</p>
<p></p>
Behavioral Finance
<p>Behavioral finance can no longer be ignored. In school, individuals need to learn about the behavioral aspects of financial literacy and how to deal with the biggest obstacle they will face on their journey to financial success: themselves.</p>
<p>Money is an emotional topic. Emotions can cause people to make suboptimal decisions. Car dealers know this. You should too.</p>

There must be proactive to solutions to deal with our human tendencies, which do not serve us well as long-term accumulators.

&lt;p&gt;Perusing social media might lead you to believe that frugality is the essence of financial literacy. Not necessarily. Frugal people rarely own airplanes or yachts. The 47 percent of Americans who are financially literate and budget-conscious, according to Harris Insights and Analytics, very well might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frugal people focus on not wasting money — on minimizing their expenses. This can be difficult for low-income households to manage thanks to liquidity restraints, according to a report in the Journal of Marketing Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though those low-income households stand to benefit the most from frugal strategies, such as the ability to buy in bulk, they are unfortunately unable to put those strategies into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people, on the other hand, understand the consequences of their financial decisions and act accordingly. They use financial resources intentionally. Financially literate people focus on making good money decisions. And the best decision often isn’t the most frugal one.&lt;/p&gt;
Living Within Your Means
&lt;p&gt;The common ground between frugality and financial literacy is living within your means. But the two approaches are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of doing well financially, living within one’s means requires that the sum of one’s expenses and savings must be at or below one’s income. This principle transcends both ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially successful, one has to live within one’s means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “means equation” says that we get to spend no more than we make. The frugality camp focuses on minimizing the expenses side of the equation. Unfortunately, neglecting the revenue side can be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
Reducing Expenses vs. Increasing Revenue
&lt;p&gt;It should be fairly apparent that there’s more room to change the revenue side of the equation than the expense side — at least theoretically. Changes to the expense side of the equation are limited to the total of the expenses — you can’t reduce your expenses beyond zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revenue side does not have this barrier. The revenue side is, theoretically, infinitely changeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get Matched With a Financial Adviser Most Suited to Your Unique Needs Maximize Your Retirement Efforts Today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a variety of challenges when it comes to making dramatic increases in the revenue side of the equation. This is especially true in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing one’s income can take a lot of time and hard work. It can also require you to make an intermediate investment, such as getting training or education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, frugality — much like laziness — pays off immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is frugality’s great benefit. Frugality as a tool can help us to navigate times of low income, such as a period of unemployment. Frugality can also help us to push out additional savings to meet a short-term goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually, a frugal lifestyle often burns us out. Living “without” robs us of many simple pleasures. It robs us of the emotional peace of enjoying simple things because it makes us believe that we’re bad for wasting money on ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
Frugality vs. Financial Literacy: The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;In the long term, we need to tell frugality to pound salt. We need to understand that our self-worth is not equal to the number of pennies saved, and we will buy that damn ice cream if we want. Some of those little expenses contribute to self-care, which is important for our mental and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy — making informed and intentional financial decisions — allows us to do what we want, if we’re willing. If we’re willing to understand the ramifications of our decisions, then the sky’s the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the sea’s the limit, depending on whether you picked the airplane or the yacht. It’s all about decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, you can have anything that you’re willing to earn and build for. Or you can spend less and have what’s left over. Frugality is a tool. Financial literacy is the whole tool set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ball is in your court. Choose wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to save money on groceries, I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I did stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not a chef, and it’s engineered to give your body everything you need to function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone, and — in theory — should still lead a perfectly normal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing your lifestyle to this extent isn’t as abnormal as you may think. In the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion, according to IBISWorld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Time Is Money
&lt;p&gt;The Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn’t about money — it was about time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think I’m being stingy with my time, but I’m young. Think of all the time I would save by not having to cook. That would effectively add months to my life! I also wouldn’t have to grocery shop very often (never, really). Soylent can be delivered to my door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason I found it so appealing was for health reasons. Stay with me, because I’m about to get pretty holistic about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love automation. Automation means you can set something good in motion and have it run without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can do awesome things without constant motivation. Think automatic bill pay or 401(k) contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Soylent, I’m constantly having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day. That means I’m having to consciously make healthy choices three-plus times per day, so I sometimes don’t eat as healthy as I should. With Soylent, I can be healthy without having to worry about the ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I wouldn’t replace all my meals with Soylent. But many of my boring meals would get replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
Vacation Meals on a Budget
&lt;p&gt;The final reason Soylent caught my eye is the cost. Prices vary based on the amount and whether it’s in bottled or powder form for you to mix, but it’s around $3 per bottle, or $3 per meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though that’s more expensive than most home-cooked meals, it saves a lot of money when traveling or just being out and about. Instead of needing to buy a meal, you can just pull a bottle out of your backpack or purse, and crack it open.&lt;/p&gt;

			Food Hacks That Save Our Readers Time and Money
            &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris: “Purple Carrot delivers a box with three vegan meals to prepare a week. The best part is that it comes with a little cookbook each time. I just buy the ingredients later on if I want to make a recipe again. It got me out of a rut of making me the same stuff…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuart: “I make my own chicken broth from store-bought rotisserie chickens. I hate using fresh onion, carrot or celery just for broth. I developed the habit of taking scraps of the three when I cook and storing them in a container in the freezer. When I need to make broth, I just dump it into my instant pot with my chicken. Saves time and money.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teresa: “Pay attention to how often your favorite products go on sale and stock up on enough to last you until the next cycle. There is a fairly predictable sales cycle.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrick: “Instant Pot. Two magic words.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tonia: “If you have the space, get a big box or upright extra freezer. Make massive batches of dishes like taco meat, slow-cooked pork, pot roast, Indian curry, rice dishes of any kind, etc. Batch them into containers so there’s no cooking during the week. We do this and order in once a week. We keep fresh broccoli, string beans and cauliflower in large Tupperware containers pre-cut and cleaned and quickly pan-fry or steam them in minutes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lisa: “Instacart. Restaurant Depot allows you to order from them to your home since the pandemic started. It’s basically Costco for restaurants.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
          
The Start of a New Diet
&lt;p&gt;I ordered my first round of Soylent a month ago straight from the website. The package arrived three days later. I opened the box and inside were a dozen white plastic bottles with black caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited to try one until the next day — I wanted to start with an empty stomach so I could get the full effect. That morning, I tried my first sip. It was oddly delicious. I was surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is designed to have a neutral flavor so that the consumer doesn’t get sick of the taste. But still, it was slightly sweet. Soylent subtly smells and tastes of a graham cracker and looks like a light cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;
An Epic Diet Fail
&lt;p&gt;About 20 minutes later, I felt like I had the flu. I ate some “real” food and the flu-like symptoms disappeared. I tried more Soylent the next day. Same reaction. I tried two more times — same reaction again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drank part of one right before doing 45 minutes of a cardio workout to check my energy levels. Exercising with the actual flu would’ve been easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Googled my symptoms. My reaction was very rare. It’s most likely the vanillin flavoring was to blame. And with that, my Soylent diet journey came to an abrupt end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my experience is negative, I still recommend you give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my mom, dad, and cousin to drink Soylent, and they all really enjoyed it. At least they can save time, enjoy better health, and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll continue my quest for a meal replacement beverage. So long, Soylent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Sullivan, director of communication at Soylent, says: “We know many people use our products to save both time and money and are able to do so successfully. However, we do not recommend anyone switching to a Soylent only diet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we always recommend everyone connect with their doctor or dietitian to decide the best overall meal plan to support your personal health goals and nutrition plan,” Sullivan adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentSai does not recommend changing your lifestyle or dietary habits without consulting your physician.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Instead of trying to save money on groceries, I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I did stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.</p>
<p>Soylent is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not a chef, and it’s engineered to give your body everything you need to function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone, and — in theory — should still lead a perfectly normal life.</p>
<p>Changing your lifestyle to this extent isn’t as abnormal as you may think. In the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion, according to IBISWorld.</p>
<p></p>
Time Is Money
<p>The Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn’t about money — it was about time.</p>
<p>You may think I’m being stingy with my time, but I’m young. Think of all the time I would save by not having to cook. That would effectively add months to my life! I also wouldn’t have to grocery shop very often (never, really). Soylent can be delivered to my door.</p>
<p>The second reason I found it so appealing was for health reasons. Stay with me, because I’m about to get pretty holistic about life.</p>
<p>I love automation. Automation means you can set something good in motion and have it run without you.</p>
<p>This means you can do awesome things without constant motivation. Think automatic bill pay or 401(k) contributions.</p>
<p>Without Soylent, I’m constantly having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day. That means I’m having to consciously make healthy choices three-plus times per day, so I sometimes don’t eat as healthy as I should. With Soylent, I can be healthy without having to worry about the ingredients.</p>
<p>Of course, I wouldn’t replace all my meals with Soylent. But many of my boring meals would get replaced.</p>
Vacation Meals on a Budget
<p>The final reason Soylent caught my eye is the cost. Prices vary based on the amount and whether it’s in bottled or powder form for you to mix, but it’s around $3 per bottle, or $3 per meal.</p>
<p>Though that’s more expensive than most home-cooked meals, it saves a lot of money when traveling or just being out and about. Instead of needing to buy a meal, you can just pull a bottle out of your backpack or purse, and crack it open.</p>

<li>Chris: “Purple Carrot delivers a box with three vegan meals to prepare a week. The best part is that it comes with a little cookbook each time. I just buy the ingredients later on if I want to make a recipe again. It got me out of a rut of making me the same stuff…”</li>
<li>Stuart: “I make my own chicken broth from store-bought rotisserie chickens. I hate using fresh onion, carrot or celery just for broth. I developed the habit of taking scraps of the three when I cook and storing them in a container in the freezer. When I need to make broth, I just dump it into my instant pot with my chicken. Saves time and money.”</li>
<li>Teresa: “Pay attention to how often your favorite products go on sale and stock up on enough to last you until the next cycle. There is a fairly predictable sales cycle.”</li>
<li>Patrick: “Instant Pot. Two magic words.”</li>
<li>Tonia: “If you have the space, get a big box or upright extra freezer. Make massive batches of dishes like taco meat, slow-cooked pork, pot roast, Indian curry, rice dishes of any kind, etc. Batch them into containers so there’s no cooking during the week. We do this and order in once a week. We keep fresh broccoli, string beans and cauliflower in large Tupperware containers pre-cut and cleaned and quickly pan-fry or steam them in minutes.”</li>
<li>Lisa: “Instacart. Restaurant Depot allows you to order from them to your home since the pandemic started. It’s basically Costco for restaurants.”</li>

]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>80405</guid><title>The Best Methodologies for Teaching Financial Literacy</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy continues to make slow strides in gaining attention, while discussions of appropriate methodologies in a school setting remain scant. The lack of sufficient attention to methodology has hindered progress; many programs lack meaningful evaluation and longitudinal studies are few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a circular problem: It is difficult to get support to expand programs when there is a lack of verifiable evidence of their effectiveness, which makes it more difficult to move forward and gain that evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A saving grace is the vast need for financial literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and people are visibly getting left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Financial Literacy Mandates
&lt;p&gt;There continues to be slow progress in the number of states requiring some form of personal financial literacy education as a high school graduation requirement. It’s now about half, which is significant, but it is clearly not where we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few states, however, require students to take a stand-alone course in personal finance. More require personal finance education integrated with other coursework. Mandates are great, but they don’t mean that it actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is concerning to see young people graduating high school barely able to read or write; there can be little confidence that they somehow attained reasonable financial literacy education while missing out on reading in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mandates are not always being followed. Schools face many challenges, and states aren’t going to push very hard on getting those who can’t read to be good with money. They probably feel they have bigger problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State financial literacy education mandates in schools are important but not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
The Feedback Challenge
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy education should make a lifetime of difference. All too often results are either not measured or measured at a point in time. And the focus tends to be on knowledge alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is important, but financial literacy is a skill; you need to apply it and use it to develop the skill. You learn skills through practicing with knowledge — both knowledge and experience are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a lot like welding — you can read a bunch of books but that does not make you competent with a torch. You need both knowledge and experience to be a good welder, as you need both knowledge and experience to be competent at any skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t matter if it is baking or flying or financial literacy, knowledge does little without experience, and experience can be an expensive and dangerous teacher in the absence of knowledge. They are inseparable; neither has meaningful value alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a classroom, there are options to develop the skills of financial literacy, just as you would with welding or baking. Financial literacy skills can be developed with cases and games, with interactive tools and with competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands-on training provides the learner with a feedback loop. They take an action and a consequence develops. Knowledge training without an experiential component is better than nothing, but it cannot compete with experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ideal situation is directly hands on. Games are a great substitute, but not the only option. Case studies, learning from stories and critiquing the actions of others, even simple exercises can add a hands-on component to knowledge training and improve the likelihood of long-term improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge has the singular advantage of being easy to test and evaluate. Assessments can measure knowledge gains whereas skill development is harder to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
Program Elements
&lt;p&gt;Effective financial literacy education needs to develop several skills. Some are overlooked in knowledge-based programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially literate, you need to be able to evaluate financial alternatives. This can be useful in day-to-day activities like comparison shopping and is essential for major purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people should be able to compare mortgage options and make a reasonable choice based on their situation and should be able to evaluate choices like leasing a car versus buying a car. Financial decision-making is an essential financial literacy skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using technology in finance is important and growing in importance. There are fantastic tools available to assist individuals in a myriad of financial challenges. But using powerful tools without knowledge of the consequences can be a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to not only know how to use technology — that’s the easy part — but they also need to know when to use technology and what the potential risks are. It is too easy to invest in risky investments with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can experience negative consequences without even knowing the consequences were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology can be wonderful and powerful, or it can be crippling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud awareness and preventing it needs to be an element of a good financial education. It has been bad out there, and it is getting worse. People need to know how to protect themselves, and where to find out what to watch for as the bad people get better at what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Behavioral Finance
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral finance can no longer be ignored. In school, individuals need to learn about the behavioral aspects of financial literacy and how to deal with the biggest obstacle they will face on their journey to financial success: themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is an emotional topic. Emotions can cause people to make suboptimal decisions. Car dealers know this. You should too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to learn about the risks behavior brings to the table — and how to combat those risks. There must be proactive to solutions to deal with our human tendencies, which do not serve us well as long-term accumulators. The more we understand and are aware of our own shortcomings the greater our ability to overcome them and achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets and volatility are not what holds investors back; behaviors in the face of market conditions and volatility are what holds investors back. Behavioral finance is an essential component of financial literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
Systems Thinking
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy can benefit from systems thinking. Nothing occurs without impacting other things. This is as true in financial matters as it is in any other system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you increase your 401(k) contributions, for example, it impacts not only your retirement preparedness, but also your cash flow and your taxes and may impact other areas of your financial life. Any single change has the potential for multiple consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, financial literacy and financial matters occur within larger systems. An individual’s numeracy skills are a codeterminant of their financial capability. Those with low numeracy skills are more likely to struggle financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numeracy education is not financial education, but supports financial education. Those challenged by numeracy need to gain knowledge of and comfort with other tools to assist with numeracy.&lt;/p&gt;
Talk It to Death
&lt;p&gt;A major aim of basic financial literacy programs is to raise awareness while developing rudimentary skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can help. We can help in our families and we can help in our workplaces. And we can help by simply talking it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can and should talk about financial matters at home. We should talk about budgets and we should talk about the process of evaluating financial alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children who grow up in a home where the parents smoke are more likely to smoke; children who grow up in homes where the parents demonstrate financial awareness and restraint are similarly more likely to pick up these habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t demonstrate the habits you don’t want the kids to pick up, and repeat the habits you would like them to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us can talk up financial literacy at work. We can be advocates for the 401(k) or other retirement plans. We can be advocates for debt reduction and we can be advocates for emergency funds and we can be advocates for budgets. And we can do that without being obnoxious. People don’t like to be told what to do, but they do love stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a passion for financial literacy or financial wellness, you can share that passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be surprised not only by how many people are interested, but also that they will make changes and be excited to tell you of their own progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk it up. Stories are a very powerful teaching tool. Talk it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;There is no silver bullet for financial illiteracy. Amazing things are happening, but we still have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy is a complex skill and we can spend a lifetime continually learning new things. But we won’t if we don’t have a solid start. Financial literacy education needs to build the foundation upon which individuals can build the financial lives they wish to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep the idea of skill or capability as a guiding principle. Knowledge of the difference among investment types is nice but evaluating those differences is essential. The skills can be used in changing situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many tools that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help. There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day. There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy the bigger difference we can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum in which we present may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always enhance financial literacy education in schools by making it experiential. That is what people will most carry forward; that is where the difference is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perusing social media might lead you to believe that frugality is the essence of financial literacy. Not necessarily. Frugal people rarely own airplanes or yachts. The 47 percent of Americans who are financially literate and budget-conscious, according to Harris Insights and Analytics, very well might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frugal people focus on not wasting money — on minimizing their expenses. This can be difficult for low-income households to manage thanks to liquidity restraints, according to a report in the Journal of Marketing Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though those low-income households stand to benefit the most from frugal strategies, such as the ability to buy in bulk, they are unfortunately unable to put those strategies into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people, on the other hand, understand the consequences of their financial decisions and act accordingly. They use financial resources intentionally. Financially literate people focus on making good money decisions. And the best decision often isn’t the most frugal one.&lt;/p&gt;
Living Within Your Means
&lt;p&gt;The common ground between frugality and financial literacy is living within your means. But the two approaches are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of doing well financially, living within one’s means requires that the sum of one’s expenses and savings must be at or below one’s income. This principle transcends both ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially successful, one has to live within one’s means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “means equation” says that we get to spend no more than we make. The frugality camp focuses on minimizing the expenses side of the equation. Unfortunately, neglecting the revenue side can be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
Reducing Expenses vs. Increasing Revenue
&lt;p&gt;It should be fairly apparent that there’s more room to change the revenue side of the equation than the expense side — at least theoretically. Changes to the expense side of the equation are limited to the total of the expenses — you can’t reduce your expenses beyond zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revenue side does not have this barrier. The revenue side is, theoretically, infinitely changeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get Matched With a Financial Adviser Most Suited to Your Unique Needs Maximize Your Retirement Efforts Today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a variety of challenges when it comes to making dramatic increases in the revenue side of the equation. This is especially true in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing one’s income can take a lot of time and hard work. It can also require you to make an intermediate investment, such as getting training or education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, frugality — much like laziness — pays off immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is frugality’s great benefit. Frugality as a tool can help us to navigate times of low income, such as a period of unemployment. Frugality can also help us to push out additional savings to meet a short-term goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually, a frugal lifestyle often burns us out. Living “without” robs us of many simple pleasures. It robs us of the emotional peace of enjoying simple things because it makes us believe that we’re bad for wasting money on ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
Frugality vs. Financial Literacy: The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;In the long term, we need to tell frugality to pound salt. We need to understand that our self-worth is not equal to the number of pennies saved, and we will buy that damn ice cream if we want. Some of those little expenses contribute to self-care, which is important for our mental and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy — making informed and intentional financial decisions — allows us to do what we want, if we’re willing. If we’re willing to understand the ramifications of our decisions, then the sky’s the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the sea’s the limit, depending on whether you picked the airplane or the yacht. It’s all about decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, you can have anything that you’re willing to earn and build for. Or you can spend less and have what’s left over. Frugality is a tool. Financial literacy is the whole tool set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ball is in your court. Choose wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Perusing social media might lead you to believe that frugality is the essence of financial literacy. Not necessarily. Frugal people rarely own airplanes or yachts. The 47 percent of Americans who are financially literate and budget-conscious, according to Harris Insights and Analytics, very well might.</p>
<p>Frugal people focus on not wasting money — on minimizing their expenses. This can be difficult for low-income households to manage thanks to liquidity restraints, according to a report in the Journal of Marketing Research.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Though those low-income households stand to benefit the most from frugal strategies, such as the ability to buy in bulk, they are unfortunately unable to put those strategies into effect.</p>
<p>Financially literate people, on the other hand, understand the consequences of their financial decisions and act accordingly. They use financial resources intentionally. Financially literate people focus on making good money decisions. And the best decision often isn’t the most frugal one.</p>
Living Within Your Means
<p>The common ground between frugality and financial literacy is living within your means. But the two approaches are quite different.</p>
<p>In the context of doing well financially, living within one’s means requires that the sum of one’s expenses and savings must be at or below one’s income. This principle transcends both ideologies.</p>
<p>To be financially successful, one has to live within one’s means.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This “means equation” says that we get to spend no more than we make. The frugality camp focuses on minimizing the expenses side of the equation. Unfortunately, neglecting the revenue side can be a big mistake.</p>
Reducing Expenses vs. Increasing Revenue
<p>It should be fairly apparent that there’s more room to change the revenue side of the equation than the expense side — at least theoretically. Changes to the expense side of the equation are limited to the total of the expenses — you can’t reduce your expenses beyond zero.</p>
<p>The revenue side does not have this barrier. The revenue side is, theoretically, infinitely changeable.</p>

<p>There may be a variety of challenges when it comes to making dramatic increases in the revenue side of the equation. This is especially true in the short term.</p>
<p>Increasing one’s income can take a lot of time and hard work. It can also require you to make an intermediate investment, such as getting training or education.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, frugality — much like laziness — pays off immediately.</p>
<p>This is frugality’s great benefit. Frugality as a tool can help us to navigate times of low income, such as a period of unemployment. Frugality can also help us to push out additional savings to meet a short-term goal.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to save money on groceries, I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I did stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not a chef, and it’s engineered to give your body everything you need to function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone, and — in theory — should still lead a perfectly normal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing your lifestyle to this extent isn’t as abnormal as you may think. In the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion, according to IBISWorld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Time Is Money
&lt;p&gt;The Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn’t about money — it was about time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think I’m being stingy with my time, but I’m young. Think of all the time I would save by not having to cook. That would effectively add months to my life! I also wouldn’t have to grocery shop very often (never, really). Soylent can be delivered to my door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason I found it so appealing was for health reasons. Stay with me, because I’m about to get pretty holistic about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love automation. Automation means you can set something good in motion and have it run without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can do awesome things without constant motivation. Think automatic bill pay or 401(k) contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Soylent, I’m constantly having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day. That means I’m having to consciously make healthy choices three-plus times per day, so I sometimes don’t eat as healthy as I should. With Soylent, I can be healthy without having to worry about the ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I wouldn’t replace all my meals with Soylent. But many of my boring meals would get replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
Vacation Meals on a Budget
&lt;p&gt;The final reason Soylent caught my eye is the cost. Prices vary based on the amount and whether it’s in bottled or powder form for you to mix, but it’s around $3 per bottle, or $3 per meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though that’s more expensive than most home-cooked meals, it saves a lot of money when traveling or just being out and about. Instead of needing to buy a meal, you can just pull a bottle out of your backpack or purse, and crack it open.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris: “Purple Carrot delivers a box with three vegan meals to prepare a week. The best part is that it comes with a little cookbook each time. I just buy the ingredients later on if I want to make a recipe again. It got me out of a rut of making me the same stuff…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuart: “I make my own chicken broth from store-bought rotisserie chickens. I hate using fresh onion, carrot or celery just for broth. I developed the habit of taking scraps of the three when I cook and storing them in a container in the freezer. When I need to make broth, I just dump it into my instant pot with my chicken. Saves time and money.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teresa: “Pay attention to how often your favorite products go on sale and stock up on enough to last you until the next cycle. There is a fairly predictable sales cycle.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrick: “Instant Pot. Two magic words.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tonia: “If you have the space, get a big box or upright extra freezer. Make massive batches of dishes like taco meat, slow-cooked pork, pot roast, Indian curry, rice dishes of any kind, etc. Batch them into containers so there’s no cooking during the week. We do this and order in once a week. We keep fresh broccoli, string beans and cauliflower in large Tupperware containers pre-cut and cleaned and quickly pan-fry or steam them in minutes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lisa: “Instacart. Restaurant Depot allows you to order from them to your home since the pandemic started. It’s basically Costco for restaurants.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arindam: “1-800-DIY.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kristen: “HelloFresh has saved me the headache of what to make and shopping for ingredients.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diane: “Make a big batch of pasta sauce or chili on Sunday, freeze some and eat some throughout the week.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
          
The Start of a New Diet
&lt;p&gt;I ordered my first round of Soylent a month ago straight from the website. The package arrived three days later. I opened the box and inside were a dozen white plastic bottles with black caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited to try one until the next day — I wanted to start with an empty stomach so I could get the full effect. That morning, I tried my first sip. It was oddly delicious. I was surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is designed to have a neutral flavor so that the consumer doesn’t get sick of the taste. But still, it was slightly sweet. Soylent subtly smells and tastes of a graham cracker and looks like a light cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;
An Epic Diet Fail
&lt;p&gt;About 20 minutes later, I felt like I had the flu. I ate some “real” food and the flu-like symptoms disappeared. I tried more Soylent the next day. Same reaction. I tried two more times — same reaction again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drank part of one right before doing 45 minutes of a cardio workout to check my energy levels. Exercising with the actual flu would’ve been easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Googled my symptoms. My reaction was very rare. It’s most likely the vanillin flavoring was to blame. And with that, my Soylent diet journey came to an abrupt end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my experience is negative, I still recommend you give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my mom, dad, and cousin to drink Soylent, and they all really enjoyed it. At least they can save time, enjoy better health, and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll continue my quest for a meal replacement beverage. So long, Soylent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Sullivan, director of communication at Soylent, says: “We know many people use our products to save both time and money and are able to do so successfully. However, we do not recommend anyone switching to a Soylent only diet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we always recommend everyone connect with their doctor or dietitian to decide the best overall meal plan to support your personal health goals and nutrition plan,” Sullivan adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentSai does not recommend changing your lifestyle or dietary habits without consulting your physician.&lt;/p&gt;

]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>80405</guid><title>The Best Methodologies for Teaching Financial Literacy</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy continues to make slow strides in gaining attention, while discussions of appropriate methodologies in a school setting remain scant. The lack of sufficient attention to methodology has hindered progress; many programs lack meaningful evaluation and longitudinal studies are few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a circular problem: It is difficult to get support to expand programs when there is a lack of verifiable evidence of their effectiveness, which makes it more difficult to move forward and gain that evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A saving grace is the vast need for financial literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and people are visibly getting left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Financial Literacy Mandates
&lt;p&gt;There continues to be slow progress in the number of states requiring some form of personal financial literacy education as a high school graduation requirement. It’s now about half, which is significant, but it is clearly not where we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few states, however, require students to take a stand-alone course in personal finance. More require personal finance education integrated with other coursework. Mandates are great, but they don’t mean that it actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is concerning to see young people graduating high school barely able to read or write; there can be little confidence that they somehow attained reasonable financial literacy education while missing out on reading in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mandates are not always being followed. Schools face many challenges, and states aren’t going to push very hard on getting those who can’t read to be good with money. They probably feel they have bigger problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State financial literacy education mandates in schools are important but not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
The Feedback Challenge
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy education should make a lifetime of difference. All too often results are either not measured or measured at a point in time. And the focus tends to be on knowledge alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is important, but financial literacy is a skill; you need to apply it and use it to develop the skill. You learn skills through practicing with knowledge — both knowledge and experience are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a lot like welding — you can read a bunch of books but that does not make you competent with a torch. You need both knowledge and experience to be a good welder, as you need both knowledge and experience to be competent at any skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t matter if it is baking or flying or financial literacy, knowledge does little without experience, and experience can be an expensive and dangerous teacher in the absence of knowledge. They are inseparable; neither has meaningful value alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a classroom, there are options to develop the skills of financial literacy, just as you would with welding or baking. Financial literacy skills can be developed with cases and games, with interactive tools and with competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands-on training provides the learner with a feedback loop. They take an action and a consequence develops. Knowledge training without an experiential component is better than nothing, but it cannot compete with experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ideal situation is directly hands on. Games are a great substitute, but not the only option. Case studies, learning from stories and critiquing the actions of others, even simple exercises can add a hands-on component to knowledge training and improve the likelihood of long-term improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge has the singular advantage of being easy to test and evaluate. Assessments can measure knowledge gains whereas skill development is harder to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
Program Elements
&lt;p&gt;Effective financial literacy education needs to develop several skills. Some are overlooked in knowledge-based programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially literate, you need to be able to evaluate financial alternatives. This can be useful in day-to-day activities like comparison shopping and is essential for major purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people should be able to compare mortgage options and make a reasonable choice based on their situation and should be able to evaluate choices like leasing a car versus buying a car. Financial decision-making is an essential financial literacy skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using technology in finance is important and growing in importance. There are fantastic tools available to assist individuals in a myriad of financial challenges. But using powerful tools without knowledge of the consequences can be a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to not only know how to use technology — that’s the easy part — but they also need to know when to use technology and what the potential risks are. It is too easy to invest in risky investments with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can experience negative consequences without even knowing the consequences were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology can be wonderful and powerful, or it can be crippling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud awareness and preventing it needs to be an element of a good financial education. It has been bad out there, and it is getting worse. People need to know how to protect themselves, and where to find out what to watch for as the bad people get better at what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Behavioral Finance
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral finance can no longer be ignored. In school, individuals need to learn about the behavioral aspects of financial literacy and how to deal with the biggest obstacle they will face on their journey to financial success: themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is an emotional topic. Emotions can cause people to make suboptimal decisions. Car dealers know this. You should too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to learn about the risks behavior brings to the table — and how to combat those risks. There must be proactive to solutions to deal with our human tendencies, which do not serve us well as long-term accumulators. The more we understand and are aware of our own shortcomings the greater our ability to overcome them and achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets and volatility are not what holds investors back; behaviors in the face of market conditions and volatility are what holds investors back. Behavioral finance is an essential component of financial literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
Systems Thinking
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy can benefit from systems thinking. Nothing occurs without impacting other things. This is as true in financial matters as it is in any other system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you increase your 401(k) contributions, for example, it impacts not only your retirement preparedness, but also your cash flow and your taxes and may impact other areas of your financial life. Any single change has the potential for multiple consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, financial literacy and financial matters occur within larger systems. An individual’s numeracy skills are a codeterminant of their financial capability. Those with low numeracy skills are more likely to struggle financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numeracy education is not financial education, but supports financial education. Those challenged by numeracy need to gain knowledge of and comfort with other tools to assist with numeracy.&lt;/p&gt;
Talk It to Death
&lt;p&gt;A major aim of basic financial literacy programs is to raise awareness while developing rudimentary skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can help. We can help in our families and we can help in our workplaces. And we can help by simply talking it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can and should talk about financial matters at home. We should talk about budgets and we should talk about the process of evaluating financial alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children who grow up in a home where the parents smoke are more likely to smoke; children who grow up in homes where the parents demonstrate financial awareness and restraint are similarly more likely to pick up these habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t demonstrate the habits you don’t want the kids to pick up, and repeat the habits you would like them to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us can talk up financial literacy at work. We can be advocates for the 401(k) or other retirement plans. We can be advocates for debt reduction and we can be advocates for emergency funds and we can be advocates for budgets. And we can do that without being obnoxious. People don’t like to be told what to do, but they do love stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a passion for financial literacy or financial wellness, you can share that passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be surprised not only by how many people are interested, but also that they will make changes and be excited to tell you of their own progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk it up. Stories are a very powerful teaching tool. Talk it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;There is no silver bullet for financial illiteracy. Amazing things are happening, but we still have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy is a complex skill and we can spend a lifetime continually learning new things. But we won’t if we don’t have a solid start. Financial literacy education needs to build the foundation upon which individuals can build the financial lives they wish to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep the idea of skill or capability as a guiding principle. Knowledge of the difference among investment types is nice but evaluating those differences is essential. The skills can be used in changing situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many tools that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help. There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day. There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy the bigger difference we can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum in which we present may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always enhance financial literacy education in schools by making it experiential. That is what people will most carry forward; that is where the difference is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Financial literacy continues to make slow strides in gaining attention, while discussions of appropriate methodologies in a school setting remain scant. The lack of sufficient attention to methodology has hindered progress; many programs lack meaningful evaluation and longitudinal studies are few.</p>
<p>This creates a circular problem: It is difficult to get support to expand programs when there is a lack of verifiable evidence of their effectiveness, which makes it more difficult to move forward and gain that evidence.</p>
<p>A saving grace is the vast need for financial literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and people are visibly getting left behind.</p>
<p></p>
Financial Literacy Mandates
<p>There continues to be slow progress in the number of states requiring some form of personal financial literacy education as a high school graduation requirement. It’s now about half, which is significant, but it is clearly not where we need to be.</p>
<p>Few states, however, require students to take a stand-alone course in personal finance. More require personal finance education integrated with other coursework. Mandates are great, but they don’t mean that it actually happens.</p>
<p>It is concerning to see young people graduating high school barely able to read or write; there can be little confidence that they somehow attained reasonable financial literacy education while missing out on reading in schools.</p>
<p>The mandates are not always being followed. Schools face many challenges, and states aren’t going to push very hard on getting those who can’t read to be good with money. They probably feel they have bigger problems.</p>
<p>State financial literacy education mandates in schools are important but not sufficient.</p>
The Feedback Challenge
<p>Financial literacy education should make a lifetime of difference. All too often results are either not measured or measured at a point in time. And the focus tends to be on knowledge alone.</p>
<p>Knowledge is important, but financial literacy is a skill; you need to apply it and use it to develop the skill. You learn skills through practicing with knowledge — both knowledge and experience are required.</p>
<p>It is a lot like welding — you can read a bunch of books but that does not make you competent with a torch. You need both knowledge and experience to be a good welder, as you need both knowledge and experience to be competent at any skill.</p>
<p>Doesn’t matter if it is baking or flying or financial literacy, knowledge does little without experience, and experience can be an expensive and dangerous teacher in the absence of knowledge. They are inseparable; neither has meaningful value alone.</p>
<p>Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents</p>
<p>In a classroom, there are options to develop the skills of financial literacy, just as you would with welding or baking. Financial literacy skills can be developed with cases and games, with interactive tools and with competitions.</p>
<p>Hands-on training provides the learner with a feedback loop. They take an action and a consequence develops. Knowledge training without an experiential component is better than nothing, but it cannot compete with experience.</p>
<p>An ideal situation is directly hands on. Games are a great substitute, but not the only option. Case studies, learning from stories and critiquing the actions of others, even simple exercises can add a hands-on component to knowledge training and improve the likelihood of long-term improvement.</p>
<p>Knowledge has the singular advantage of being easy to test and evaluate. Assessments can measure knowledge gains whereas skill development is harder to evaluate.</p>
Program Elements
<p>Effective financial literacy education needs to develop several skills. Some are overlooked in knowledge-based programs.</p>
<p>To be financially literate, you need to be able to evaluate financial alternatives. This can be useful in day-to-day activities like comparison shopping and is essential for major purchases.</p>
<p>Financially literate people should be able to compare mortgage options and make a reasonable choice based on their situation and should be able to evaluate choices like leasing a car versus buying a car. Financial decision-making is an essential financial literacy skill.</p>
<p>Using technology in finance is important and growing in importance. There are fantastic tools available to assist individuals in a myriad of financial challenges. But using powerful tools without knowledge of the consequences can be a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>Students need to not only know how to use technology — that’s the easy part — but they also need to know when to use technology and what the potential risks are. It is too easy to invest in risky investments with technology.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can experience negative consequences without even knowing the consequences were possible.</p>
<p>Technology can be wonderful and powerful, or it can be crippling.</p>
<p>Fraud awareness and preventing it needs to be an element of a good financial education. It has been bad out there, and it is getting worse. People need to know how to protect themselves, and where to find out what to watch for as the bad people get better at what they do.</p>
<p></p>
Behavioral Finance
<p>Behavioral finance can no longer be ignored. In school, individuals need to learn about the behavioral aspects of financial literacy and how to deal with the biggest obstacle they will face on their journey to financial success: themselves.</p>
<p>Money is an emotional topic. Emotions can cause people to make suboptimal decisions. Car dealers know this. You should too.</p>
<p>Students need to learn about the risks behavior brings to the table — and how to combat those risks. There must be proactive to solutions to deal with our human tendencies, which do not serve us well as long-term accumulators. The more we understand and are aware of our own shortcomings the greater our ability to overcome them and achieve success.</p>
<p>Markets and volatility are not what holds investors back; behaviors in the face of market conditions and volatility are what holds investors back. Behavioral finance is an essential component of financial literacy.</p>
Systems Thinking
<p>Financial literacy can benefit from systems thinking. Nothing occurs without impacting other things. This is as true in financial matters as it is in any other system.</p>
<p>If you increase your 401(k) contributions, for example, it impacts not only your retirement preparedness, but also your cash flow and your taxes and may impact other areas of your financial life. Any single change has the potential for multiple consequences.</p>
<p>Likewise, financial literacy and financial matters occur within larger systems. An individual’s numeracy skills are a codeterminant of their financial capability. Those with low numeracy skills are more likely to struggle financially.</p>
<p>Numeracy education is not financial education, but supports financial education. Those challenged by numeracy need to gain knowledge of and comfort with other tools to assist with numeracy.</p>
Talk It to Death
<p>A major aim of basic financial literacy programs is to raise awareness while developing rudimentary skills.</p>
<p>We can help. We can help in our families and we can help in our workplaces. And we can help by simply talking it to death.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Perusing social media might lead you to believe that frugality is the essence of financial literacy. Not necessarily. Frugal people rarely own airplanes or yachts. The 47 percent of Americans who are financially literate and budget-conscious, according to Harris Insights and Analytics, very well might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frugal people focus on not wasting money — on minimizing their expenses. This can be difficult for low-income households to manage thanks to liquidity restraints, according to a report in the Journal of Marketing Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though those low-income households stand to benefit the most from frugal strategies, such as the ability to buy in bulk, they are unfortunately unable to put those strategies into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people, on the other hand, understand the consequences of their financial decisions and act accordingly. They use financial resources intentionally. Financially literate people focus on making good money decisions. And the best decision often isn’t the most frugal one.&lt;/p&gt;
Living Within Your Means
&lt;p&gt;The common ground between frugality and financial literacy is living within your means. But the two approaches are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of doing well financially, living within one’s means requires that the sum of one’s expenses and savings must be at or below one’s income. This principle transcends both ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially successful, one has to live within one’s means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “means equation” says that we get to spend no more than we make. The frugality camp focuses on minimizing the expenses side of the equation. Unfortunately, neglecting the revenue side can be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
Reducing Expenses vs. Increasing Revenue
&lt;p&gt;It should be fairly apparent that there’s more room to change the revenue side of the equation than the expense side — at least theoretically. Changes to the expense side of the equation are limited to the total of the expenses — you can’t reduce your expenses beyond zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revenue side does not have this barrier. The revenue side is, theoretically, infinitely changeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get Matched With a Financial Adviser Most Suited to Your Unique Needs Maximize Your Retirement Efforts Today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a variety of challenges when it comes to making dramatic increases in the revenue side of the equation. This is especially true in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing one’s income can take a lot of time and hard work. It can also require you to make an intermediate investment, such as getting training or education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, frugality — much like laziness — pays off immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is frugality’s great benefit. Frugality as a tool can help us to navigate times of low income, such as a period of unemployment. Frugality can also help us to push out additional savings to meet a short-term goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually, a frugal lifestyle often burns us out. Living “without” robs us of many simple pleasures. It robs us of the emotional peace of enjoying simple things because it makes us believe that we’re bad for wasting money on ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
Frugality vs. Financial Literacy: The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;In the long term, we need to tell frugality to pound salt. We need to understand that our self-worth is not equal to the number of pennies saved, and we will buy that damn ice cream if we want. Some of those little expenses contribute to self-care, which is important for our mental and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy — making informed and intentional financial decisions — allows us to do what we want, if we’re willing. If we’re willing to understand the ramifications of our decisions, then the sky’s the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the sea’s the limit, depending on whether you picked the airplane or the yacht. It’s all about decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, you can have anything that you’re willing to earn and build for. Or you can spend less and have what’s left over. Frugality is a tool. Financial literacy is the whole tool set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ball is in your court. Choose wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the best business ideas are right in front of you. That was the case for Ashley Clark, who pivoted from being a banker to an entrepreneur and creator of old-school board games and flashcards that teach financial literacy — going against the current trend of online gaming with six-figure success during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade as a banker underscored that too many people didn’t understand their own finances. Clark began to write down common customer questions — using this as her initial “market research.” Next was her tough focus group: her children. Her passion for teaching people about money flourished, and today Clark is CEO and founder of Sense 2 Cents, a financial literacy–based games company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sense 2 Cents aims to take the chore out of learning and foster a solid financial foundation by making the flashcards and board games a family activity, in which parents can learn alongside their children. Clark has also developed active communities on Instagram and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t all smooth sailing: Three months into starting this venture, Clark was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and, being so ill, she understandably wanted to quit. Advice from her entrepreneurial mom helped her stay focused, and now she has tips for those starting their own business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this episode of SheVentures, discover why financial literacy is so important in establishing generational wealth in under-served communities, what financial institutions can do to help, and Clark’s top tips for success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial planning is often pictured in graphic images as an upwardly sloping straight-line path that moves seamlessly from Point A to Point B. People set financial goals, develop a plan, “work the plan” by taking action to reach their goals, and review and revise the plan every so often or when major lifestyle changes occur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this approach can sometimes work well in normal times, the past year has been anything but normal as a result of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many personal financial plans (e.g., jobs, education, moving, travel, retirement dates) “blew up” amid layoffs, lockdowns, deaths of loved ones, and lives fraught with uncertainty. In addition, legislation and the law of supply and demand (i.e., the current U.S. housing market) presented opportunities that nobody could have foreseen, much less planned for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better graphic image for the financial planning process for many people, especially during the past year, is a tangled ball of yarn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five examples are presented, below, of “accidental” financial planning opportunities that were not on most people’s radar screens until recently. They could not have been included in personal financial plans previously because they were not feasible, not applicable, or did not exist under previous tax laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these strategies have arisen in some way, shape, or form as a result of the pandemic and may be useful to consider during the months ahead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Deploy Tax Savings From Unemployment Tax Leniency&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), signed into law on March 12, many taxpayers are exempt from income tax on up to $10,200 of unemployment benefits that were received during 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, this money would be fully taxable as ordinary income (i.e., at a taxpayer’s regular marginal tax rate, like wages, salaries, and tips) on federal tax returns. This tax break was a last-minute addition to the ARPA that few people saw coming and came a month into the 2020 tax filing season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people probably had taxes withheld on their unemployment benefits or sent the IRS quarterly estimated payments in expectation of a future tax liability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the ARPA tax law change, those individuals could now save $1,000 or more on their income taxes (depending on their tax rate and other income sources), resulting in a larger refund or a smaller tax bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, $9,000 in unemployment benefits in the 12 percent tax bracket = $1,080 (9,000 x .12). This is a nice chunk of change to save or repay debt with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Take Tax Credits Available as a Result of Reduced Income&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some taxpayers may qualify for income tax breaks in 2020 for which they previously earned too much income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which maxes out at $15,280 ($21,710) of adjusted gross income (AGI) for a single taxpayer and married couple filing jointly with no children and $41,756 ($47, 646), $47, 440 ($53,330), and $50,594 ($56,844) with one, two, and three or more children, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximum credit amounts on 2020 tax returns for zero, one, two, and three or more children are respectively $538, $3,584, $5,920, and $6,660. A tax credit is a dollar for dollar reduction in tax liability (e.g., $6,000 tentative tax bill minus $3,584 EITC = $2,416 final tax bill). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time ever, perhaps, taxpayers who always earned more than the maximum AGI for the EITC may qualify if they lost income as a result of the pandemic. The tax savings could provide funds for an emergency fund or debt repayment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Use a Big House Profit to Pay Off Accumulated Debt&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some homeowners who lost income and got behind on mortgage payments are cashing out during the current “red hot” housing market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one case that I know of, a home seller who owes over $18,000 in arrearages on a federally backed FHA mortgage and has no money with which to repay it when the foreclosure moratorium expires on June 30 will make about a $60,000 profit as a result of selling the house in a bidding war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After paying back the mortgage arrearage and home selling expenses, the seller will walk away with about $20,000 after less than two years of homeownership and will “punt back” to apartment living until household finances stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Use a Big House Profit and Downsizing to Build a Retirement Nest Egg&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, people who planned to move and downsize anyway and lack sufficient retirement savings can benefit from selling their home in the current sellers’ market and moving to something smaller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They essentially become cash buyers who are better able to compete for new housing in the area where they live or elsewhere. In addition, the spread between their old home’s price and the cost of a new one provides income for future living expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, $300,000 of home sale profit placed in a balanced mutual fund with a 6 percent average return will throw off about $18,000 of annual income.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Increase Savings and Philanthropy&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Americans have experienced financial silver linings that they could have not anticipated as a result of COVID-19: increased income due to demand for their industry sector or work skills and/or reduced expenses such as commuting costs, child care, and other expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like home sale profit and income tax breaks, increased cash flow provides an opportunity for increased savings, debt reduction, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also new opportunities for philanthropy. On 2020 tax returns, married couples filing jointly or singles who do not itemize can deduct $300 in cash contributions to qualified charities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, the tax write-off for couples increases to $600. In addition, the 60 percent of AGI cap on donations made by itemizing taxpayers is suspended in 2021 to encourage philanthropy for coronavirus relief.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Financial planning is often pictured in graphic images as an upwardly sloping straight-line path that moves seamlessly from Point A to Point B. People set financial goals, develop a plan, “work the plan” by taking action to reach their goals, and review and revise the plan every so often or when major lifestyle changes occur. </p>
<p>Though this approach can sometimes work well in normal times, the past year has been anything but normal as a result of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Many personal financial plans (e.g., jobs, education, moving, travel, retirement dates) “blew up” amid layoffs, lockdowns, deaths of loved ones, and lives fraught with uncertainty. In addition, legislation and the law of supply and demand (i.e., the current U.S. housing market) presented opportunities that nobody could have foreseen, much less planned for. </p>
<p>A better graphic image for the financial planning process for many people, especially during the past year, is a tangled ball of yarn.</p>
<p>Five examples are presented, below, of “accidental” financial planning opportunities that were not on most people’s radar screens until recently. They could not have been included in personal financial plans previously because they were not feasible, not applicable, or did not exist under previous tax laws. </p>
<p>All of these strategies have arisen in some way, shape, or form as a result of the pandemic and may be useful to consider during the months ahead:</p>
<b>Deploy Tax Savings From Unemployment Tax Leniency</b>
<p>Under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), signed into law on March 12, many taxpayers are exempt from income tax on up to $10,200 of unemployment benefits that were received during 2020. </p>
<p>Normally, this money would be fully taxable as ordinary income (i.e., at a taxpayer’s regular marginal tax rate, like wages, salaries, and tips) on federal tax returns. This tax break was a last-minute addition to the ARPA that few people saw coming and came a month into the 2020 tax filing season. </p>
<p>Most people probably had taxes withheld on their unemployment benefits or sent the IRS quarterly estimated payments in expectation of a future tax liability. </p>
<p>As a result of the ARPA tax law change, those individuals could now save $1,000 or more on their income taxes (depending on their tax rate and other income sources), resulting in a larger refund or a smaller tax bill. </p>
<p>For example, $9,000 in unemployment benefits in the 12 percent tax bracket = $1,080 (9,000 x .12). This is a nice chunk of change to save or repay debt with.</p>
<b>Take Tax Credits Available as a Result of Reduced Income</b>
<p>Some taxpayers may qualify for income tax breaks in 2020 for which they previously earned too much income. </p>
<p>One example is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which maxes out at $15,280 ($21,710) of adjusted gross income (AGI) for a single taxpayer and married couple filing jointly with no children and $41,756 ($47, 646), $47, 440 ($53,330), and $50,594 ($56,844) with one, two, and three or more children, respectively.</p>
<p>The maximum credit amounts on 2020 tax returns for zero, one, two, and three or more children are respectively $538, $3,584, $5,920, and $6,660. A tax credit is a dollar for dollar reduction in tax liability (e.g., $6,000 tentative tax bill minus $3,584 EITC = $2,416 final tax bill). </p>
<p>For the first time ever, perhaps, taxpayers who always earned more than the maximum AGI for the EITC may qualify if they lost income as a result of the pandemic. The tax savings could provide funds for an emergency fund or debt repayment.</p>
<b>Use a Big House Profit to Pay Off Accumulated Debt</b>
<p>Some homeowners who lost income and got behind on mortgage payments are cashing out during the current “red hot” housing market. </p>
<p>In one case that I know of, a home seller who owes over $18,000 in arrearages on a federally backed FHA mortgage and has no money with which to repay it when the foreclosure moratorium expires on June 30 will make about a $60,000 profit as a result of selling the house in a bidding war. </p>
<p>After paying back the mortgage arrearage and home selling expenses, the seller will walk away with about $20,000 after less than two years of homeownership and will “punt back” to apartment living until household finances stabilize.</p>

<p>They essentially become cash buyers who are better able to compete for new housing in the area where they live or elsewhere. In addition, the spread between their old home’s price and the cost of a new one provides income for future living expenses. </p>
<p>For example, $300,000 of home sale profit placed in a balanced mutual fund with a 6 percent average return will throw off about $18,000 of annual income.<b> </b></p>
<b>Increase Savings and Philanthropy</b>

&lt;p&gt;Tiny homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just saying the name brings to mind images of adorable rolling cottages, cutting-edge lifestyles, and minimal possessions and worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve all seen the TV shows, listened to the podcasts, and fantasized a bit about living in a home in the forest or on a plot of land near a creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those saddled with debt, the idea of a tiny home that costs less than $20,000 sounds like a great idea. Buying a standard house means spending money on a down payment, insurance, interest, and taxes, not to mention maintenance over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The down payment alone is an extreme obstacle to 62 percent of millennials who would not be able to afford a home, according to a survey by Apartment List, while an additional 29 percent claim that the monthly payments would be a severe financial burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This begs the question: Given their low cost, are tiny homes good investments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much does living the “tiny life” actually cost, and what kind of resale value can you expect from owning a tiny house?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
What Are Tiny Homes?
&lt;p&gt;In a few words, the tiny home movement is an effort to combat the prevalence of McMansions. It’s about reducing the size of the space you live in, meaning that many tiny homes are under 500 square feet. They can be made from vans, miniature constructions, or even from storage containers that real estate entrepreneurs like Janelle Briggs provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, there are more than 10,000 tiny homes, according to Go Downsize, and the trend seems to be rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiny-home dwellers may downsize for a variety of reasons — environmental concerns, financial difficulties, or simply for flexibility and freedom. Many tiny homes are mobile, so you can take them wherever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
What Kind of Investment Is a Tiny Home?
&lt;p&gt;One of the things people love most about tiny homes is their endless customizability, which also makes it difficult to answer the question of how much tiny homes cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that they are easily personalized, this makes it difficult to find an average price for tiny homes, as size, materials, and finishes can vary greatly. The figure runs from about $8,000 for a DIY tiny home with minimal fixtures all the way up to $150,000 and beyond for a custom-built tiny home with luxe fittings and features, according to Home Advisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest factors in pricing out a tiny home are materials and labor costs. Anyone who’s worked with a contractor can tell you that those items aren’t cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re willing to do a large portion of the work yourself, you can significantly lower the cost of your home. When looking at a tiny home as an investment, you have to put a dollar value on your own labor. This tells you the real cost, in both money and time spent, of building one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials are the next largest pricing factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re savvy and willing to spend some time researching, you can often find reclaimed materials or leftovers from a job site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are entire stores that sell nothing but the extra parts and slightly damaged fixtures from major building companies. These stores are often local businesses, so a quick Google search should bring up the appropriate place to go depending on your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiny living can be either inexpensive or about the cost of a small starter home. Try finding a $100,000 home with truly top-of-the-line fittings.&lt;/p&gt;

The Cost of Living in a Tiny Home
&lt;p&gt;Living in a tiny home can be incredibly affordable. Heating, cooling, and cleaning 300 square feet is a whole lot cheaper and easier than doing so for a 2,322-square-foot home (the median new home size in 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can reduce your water, power, and other bills even further if you choose to live a sustainability focused lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar panels, well water, and options such as a wood stove for heating can drop your living expenses substantially and shrink your carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other expenses to consider, though, especially if you’re living in a tiny house on wheels and plan to travel. Gas, insurance, and campground fees can add up fast.&lt;/p&gt;
Finding a Place to Live
&lt;p&gt;One thing that you have to take into account when considering the cost and value of tiny living is where you live. Most American cities aren’t tiny-home friendly. Many zoning laws prohibit full-time tiny-home habitation across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you plan to stay in one place, you have to find land that allows tiny homes and has the necessary improvements with water, sewage, and electrical hookups. Many tiny-home dwellers get around this by living on family land or going out into a more rural area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re more sustainably minded, a tiny home is one of the best ways to explore alternative lifestyles. This allows you to disconnect from traditional ways of Western life and see what living off the grid can be like.&lt;/p&gt;
The Resale Market
&lt;p&gt;If you just go by all the reality shows and hype you’d think the tiny home market was absolutely booming. The reality is, well, a tiny bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiny homes are popular, in a big way. But that doesn’t mean that everyone, or even most people, are willing to live in one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask any real estate agent about home renovations, and they’ll advise you to go for broader appeal. Look for the improvements that match the largest portion of the market’s taste and try not to over customize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 56 percent of Americans would consider living in a tiny home, according to a survey by IPX 1031, a Fidelity National financial company. Anything that has such a limited market — or liquidity — is going to be harder to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
Taking Out a Loan
&lt;p&gt;The biggest selling point for tiny homes is that you don’t need to take out a mortgage, according to Hannah Maman, a real estate agent in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won’t find a traditional home loan for a tiny house because most mortgage lenders have minimum loan amounts that are much higher than the one needed for a tiny house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, typical mortgage lenders won’t give out a loan because many tiny houses are on wheels/transportable and not on a foundation, and most lenders require a permanent foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, Maman explains that you can finance directly through a builder or take out either a personal loan or an RV loan. If you are to take out an RV loan for a tiny house, it must first be certified under the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association (to show it’s safe for the road). You can expect to get about 4 to 9 percent interest rates here on a term of 70 to 85 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you aren’t association certified and would rather take out a personal loan, this is doable. It would just be an unsecured personal loan with a higher interest rate, in the 7 to 11 percent range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So many individuals are struggling with debt and are looking for viable alternatives to being locked into a 30-year mortgage,” Maman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even maintenance and utility bills are cut in half, which saves people a ton of money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Maman states, “I think people need to be aware that buying a tiny home, in most cases, isn’t the same as buying a traditional home.” Continue reading below to find out why this kind of investment may not be for you.&lt;/p&gt;

Do Tiny Homes Appreciate in Value?
&lt;p&gt;Best answer: It’s complicated. Traditional wisdom tells us owning a house over a long period of time — say at least five years — can be a good way to grow your money. After all, don’t homes grow in value over time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land that your home sits on may appreciate in value, but the physical house is actually depreciating. The same thing holds true for tiny homes, with the added twist that you don’t usually own any land under them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t expect your tiny home to appreciate in value like a traditional home, advises Noaz Miller, a home-insurance specialist in Scottsdale, Arizona. Location is the key factor that predicts valuation, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Land typically appreciates or depreciates with the local market,” Miller says. Any traditional home with a permanent foundation will have better resale value than a tiny home on wheels, which will depreciate in value like an RV.&lt;/p&gt;
Tiny Homes as Passive Income Investments
&lt;p&gt;If you’re renting out a tiny home, it could be a source of passive income, as is any other rental property. But be aware that there are a host of considerations to consider before becoming a landlord, such as state and local laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A landlord should use a legally reviewed template for their state when creating a lease. States vary in terms of their protections for tenants and landlords, so ensure you protect yourself as much as possible in the event that any tenant falls far enough behind on rent that legal intervention is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One should also take into careful consideration the financial aspects of maintaining the property. Last, be sure to screen your tenants. As problems arise, you will likely be the one responsible for fixing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The Downsides of Tiny Homes
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in living in a tiny home, take care to consider the effects that the size of tiny homes can have on your life. Sure, it would be awesome to travel the world in a tiny home on wheels, but the little rational voice might start screaming, “No! You don’t have a remote job, so you can’t just pick up and go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also may need more than 500 square feet of space. If you ever intend to host friends and have family stay with you, you need more than one bedroom and bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention the difficult regulations that you would have to abide by if you built your own tiny home. Most tiny homes have wheels to avoid the zoning laws in the city, leaving owners scrambling to find a place to park it legally. Some might be able to put it in the backyard of a regular home, but the area must have the proper zoning to accommodate full-time camping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the tiny house has a foundation and isn’t on wheels, it would have to comply with building codes, which usually means it must be a minimum of 700 square feet. For that reason, many people turn to rural areas where land is less expensive to build and park their tiny homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you’re a city person, it may not be practical for you to live out in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;A tiny home can be a great investment for the right person. If you want to build your own house, travel the country with it, and embrace an alternative lifestyle, a tiny home can be an affordable way to accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can customize the home almost endlessly and save money on rent and utilities. It also allows you to take the comforts of home to all kinds of wild and beautiful places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to go tiny with an eye toward reselling your home down the line and realizing gains, you may be disappointed. Tiny homes depreciate and can be difficult to sell, so they might not make good investments in that sense. And if you want to live in a major city, it can be difficult and expensive to find somewhere to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>A landlord should use a legally reviewed template for their state when creating a lease. States vary in terms of their protections for tenants and landlords, so ensure you protect yourself as much as possible in the event that any tenant falls far enough behind on rent that legal intervention is needed.</p>
<p>One should also take into careful consideration the financial aspects of maintaining the property. Last, be sure to screen your tenants. As problems arise, you will likely be the one responsible for fixing them.</p>
<p></p>
The Downsides of Tiny Homes
<p>If you’re interested in living in a tiny home, take care to consider the effects that the size of tiny homes can have on your life. Sure, it would be awesome to travel the world in a tiny home on wheels, but the little rational voice might start screaming, “No! You don’t have a remote job, so you can’t just pick up and go.”</p>
<p>You also may need more than 500 square feet of space. If you ever intend to host friends and have family stay with you, you need more than one bedroom and bathroom.</p>
<p>Not to mention the difficult regulations that you would have to abide by if you built your own tiny home. Most tiny homes have wheels to avoid the zoning laws in the city, leaving owners scrambling to find a place to park it legally. Some might be able to put it in the backyard of a regular home, but the area must have the proper zoning to accommodate full-time camping.</p>
<p>If the tiny house has a foundation and isn’t on wheels, it would have to comply with building codes, which usually means it must be a minimum of 700 square feet. For that reason, many people turn to rural areas where land is less expensive to build and park their tiny homes.</p>
<p>But if you’re a city person, it may not be practical for you to live out in the woods.</p>
The Bottom Line
<p>A tiny home can be a great investment for the right person. If you want to build your own house, travel the country with it, and embrace an alternative lifestyle, a tiny home can be an affordable way to accomplish this.</p>
<p>You can customize the home almost endlessly and save money on rent and utilities. It also allows you to take the comforts of home to all kinds of wild and beautiful places.</p>
<p>If you want to go tiny with an eye toward reselling your home down the line and realizing gains, you may be disappointed. Tiny homes depreciate and can be difficult to sell, so they might not make good investments in that sense. And if you want to live in a major city, it can be difficult and expensive to find somewhere to do so.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to save money on groceries, I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I did stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not a chef, and it’s engineered to give your body everything you need to function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone, and — in theory — should still lead a perfectly normal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing your lifestyle to this extent isn’t as abnormal as you may think. In the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion, according to IBISWorld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Time Is Money
&lt;p&gt;The Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn’t about money — it was about time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think I’m being stingy with my time, but I’m young. Think of all the time I would save by not having to cook. That would effectively add months to my life! I also wouldn’t have to grocery shop very often (never, really). Soylent can be delivered to my door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason I found it so appealing was for health reasons. Stay with me, because I’m about to get pretty holistic about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love automation. Automation means you can set something good in motion and have it run without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can do awesome things without constant motivation. Think automatic bill pay or 401(k) contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Soylent, I’m constantly having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day. That means I’m having to consciously make healthy choices three-plus times per day, so I sometimes don’t eat as healthy as I should. With Soylent, I can be healthy without having to worry about the ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I wouldn’t replace all my meals with Soylent. But many of my boring meals would get replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
Vacation Meals on a Budget
&lt;p&gt;The final reason Soylent caught my eye is the cost. Prices vary based on the amount and whether it’s in bottled or powder form for you to mix, but it’s around $3 per bottle, or $3 per meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though that’s more expensive than most home-cooked meals, it saves a lot of money when traveling or just being out and about. Instead of needing to buy a meal, you can just pull a bottle out of your backpack or purse, and crack it open.&lt;/p&gt;

			Food Hacks That Save Our Readers Time and Money
            &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris: “Purple Carrot delivers a box with three vegan meals to prepare a week. The best part is that it comes with a little cookbook each time. I just buy the ingredients later on if I want to make a recipe again. It got me out of a rut of making me the same stuff…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuart: “I make my own chicken broth from store-bought rotisserie chickens. I hate using fresh onion, carrot or celery just for broth. I developed the habit of taking scraps of the three when I cook and storing them in a container in the freezer. When I need to make broth, I just dump it into my instant pot with my chicken. Saves time and money.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teresa: “Pay attention to how often your favorite products go on sale and stock up on enough to last you until the next cycle. There is a fairly predictable sales cycle.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrick: “Instant Pot. Two magic words.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tonia: “If you have the space, get a big box or upright extra freezer. Make massive batches of dishes like taco meat, slow-cooked pork, pot roast, Indian curry, rice dishes of any kind, etc. Batch them into containers so there’s no cooking during the week. We do this and order in once a week. We keep fresh broccoli, string beans and cauliflower in large Tupperware containers pre-cut and cleaned and quickly pan-fry or steam them in minutes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lisa: “Instacart. Restaurant Depot allows you to order from them to your home since the pandemic started. It’s basically Costco for restaurants.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arindam: “1-800-DIY.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kristen: “HelloFresh has saved me the headache of what to make and shopping for ingredients.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diane: “Make a big batch of pasta sauce or chili on Sunday, freeze some and eat some throughout the week.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
          
The Start of a New Diet
&lt;p&gt;I ordered my first round of Soylent a month ago straight from the website. The package arrived three days later. I opened the box and inside were a dozen white plastic bottles with black caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited to try one until the next day — I wanted to start with an empty stomach so I could get the full effect. That morning, I tried my first sip. It was oddly delicious. I was surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is designed to have a neutral flavor so that the consumer doesn’t get sick of the taste. But still, it was slightly sweet. Soylent subtly smells and tastes of a graham cracker and looks like a light cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;
An Epic Diet Fail
&lt;p&gt;About 20 minutes later, I felt like I had the flu. I ate some “real” food and the flu-like symptoms disappeared. I tried more Soylent the next day. Same reaction. I tried two more times — same reaction again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drank part of one right before doing 45 minutes of a cardio workout to check my energy levels. Exercising with the actual flu would’ve been easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Googled my symptoms. My reaction was very rare. It’s most likely the vanillin flavoring was to blame. And with that, my Soylent diet journey came to an abrupt end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my experience is negative, I still recommend you give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my mom, dad, and cousin to drink Soylent, and they all really enjoyed it. At least they can save time, enjoy better health, and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll continue my quest for a meal replacement beverage. So long, Soylent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Sullivan, director of communication at Soylent, says: “We know many people use our products to save both time and money and are able to do so successfully. However, we do not recommend anyone switching to a Soylent only diet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we always recommend everyone connect with their doctor or dietitian to decide the best overall meal plan to support your personal health goals and nutrition plan,” Sullivan adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentSai does not recommend changing your lifestyle or dietary habits without consulting your physician.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Jamie Sullivan, director of communication at Soylent, says: “We know many people use our products to save both time and money and are able to do so successfully. However, we do not recommend anyone switching to a Soylent only diet.”</p>
<p>“Additionally, we always recommend everyone connect with their doctor or dietitian to decide the best overall meal plan to support your personal health goals and nutrition plan,” Sullivan adds.</p>
<p>CentSai does not recommend changing your lifestyle or dietary habits without consulting your physician.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy continues to make slow strides in gaining attention, while discussions of appropriate methodologies in a school setting remain scant. The lack of sufficient attention to methodology has hindered progress; many programs lack meaningful evaluation and longitudinal studies are few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a circular problem: It is difficult to get support to expand programs when there is a lack of verifiable evidence of their effectiveness, which makes it more difficult to move forward and gain that evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A saving grace is the vast need for financial literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and people are visibly getting left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Financial Literacy Mandates
&lt;p&gt;There continues to be slow progress in the number of states requiring some form of personal financial literacy education as a high school graduation requirement. It’s now about half, which is significant, but it is clearly not where we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few states, however, require students to take a stand-alone course in personal finance. More require personal finance education integrated with other coursework. Mandates are great, but they don’t mean that it actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is concerning to see young people graduating high school barely able to read or write; there can be little confidence that they somehow attained reasonable financial literacy education while missing out on reading in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mandates are not always being followed. Schools face many challenges, and states aren’t going to push very hard on getting those who can’t read to be good with money. They probably feel they have bigger problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State financial literacy education mandates in schools are important but not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
The Feedback Challenge
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy education should make a lifetime of difference. All too often results are either not measured or measured at a point in time. And the focus tends to be on knowledge alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is important, but financial literacy is a skill; you need to apply it and use it to develop the skill. You learn skills through practicing with knowledge — both knowledge and experience are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a lot like welding — you can read a bunch of books but that does not make you competent with a torch. You need both knowledge and experience to be a good welder, as you need both knowledge and experience to be competent at any skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t matter if it is baking or flying or financial literacy, knowledge does little without experience, and experience can be an expensive and dangerous teacher in the absence of knowledge. They are inseparable; neither has meaningful value alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a classroom, there are options to develop the skills of financial literacy, just as you would with welding or baking. Financial literacy skills can be developed with cases and games, with interactive tools and with competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands-on training provides the learner with a feedback loop. They take an action and a consequence develops. Knowledge training without an experiential component is better than nothing, but it cannot compete with experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ideal situation is directly hands on. Games are a great substitute, but not the only option. Case studies, learning from stories and critiquing the actions of others, even simple exercises can add a hands-on component to knowledge training and improve the likelihood of long-term improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge has the singular advantage of being easy to test and evaluate. Assessments can measure knowledge gains whereas skill development is harder to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
Program Elements
&lt;p&gt;Effective financial literacy education needs to develop several skills. Some are overlooked in knowledge-based programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially literate, you need to be able to evaluate financial alternatives. This can be useful in day-to-day activities like comparison shopping and is essential for major purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people should be able to compare mortgage options and make a reasonable choice based on their situation and should be able to evaluate choices like leasing a car versus buying a car. Financial decision-making is an essential financial literacy skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using technology in finance is important and growing in importance. There are fantastic tools available to assist individuals in a myriad of financial challenges. But using powerful tools without knowledge of the consequences can be a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to not only know how to use technology — that’s the easy part — but they also need to know when to use technology and what the potential risks are. It is too easy to invest in risky investments with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can experience negative consequences without even knowing the consequences were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology can be wonderful and powerful, or it can be crippling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud awareness and preventing it needs to be an element of a good financial education. It has been bad out there, and it is getting worse. People need to know how to protect themselves, and where to find out what to watch for as the bad people get better at what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Behavioral Finance
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral finance can no longer be ignored. In school, individuals need to learn about the behavioral aspects of financial literacy and how to deal with the biggest obstacle they will face on their journey to financial success: themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is an emotional topic. Emotions can cause people to make suboptimal decisions. Car dealers know this. You should too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to learn about the risks behavior brings to the table — and how to combat those risks. There must be proactive to solutions to deal with our human tendencies, which do not serve us well as long-term accumulators. The more we understand and are aware of our own shortcomings the greater our ability to overcome them and achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets and volatility are not what holds investors back; behaviors in the face of market conditions and volatility are what holds investors back. Behavioral finance is an essential component of financial literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
Systems Thinking
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy can benefit from systems thinking. Nothing occurs without impacting other things. This is as true in financial matters as it is in any other system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you increase your 401(k) contributions, for example, it impacts not only your retirement preparedness, but also your cash flow and your taxes and may impact other areas of your financial life. Any single change has the potential for multiple consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, financial literacy and financial matters occur within larger systems. An individual’s numeracy skills are a codeterminant of their financial capability. Those with low numeracy skills are more likely to struggle financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numeracy education is not financial education, but supports financial education. Those challenged by numeracy need to gain knowledge of and comfort with other tools to assist with numeracy.&lt;/p&gt;
Talk It to Death
&lt;p&gt;A major aim of basic financial literacy programs is to raise awareness while developing rudimentary skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can help. We can help in our families and we can help in our workplaces. And we can help by simply talking it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can and should talk about financial matters at home. We should talk about budgets and we should talk about the process of evaluating financial alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children who grow up in a home where the parents smoke are more likely to smoke; children who grow up in homes where the parents demonstrate financial awareness and restraint are similarly more likely to pick up these habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t demonstrate the habits you don’t want the kids to pick up, and repeat the habits you would like them to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us can talk up financial literacy at work. We can be advocates for the 401(k) or other retirement plans. We can be advocates for debt reduction and we can be advocates for emergency funds and we can be advocates for budgets. And we can do that without being obnoxious. People don’t like to be told what to do, but they do love stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a passion for financial literacy or financial wellness, you can share that passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be surprised not only by how many people are interested, but also that they will make changes and be excited to tell you of their own progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk it up. Stories are a very powerful teaching tool. Talk it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;There is no silver bullet for financial illiteracy. Amazing things are happening, but we still have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy is a complex skill and we can spend a lifetime continually learning new things. But we won’t if we don’t have a solid start. Financial literacy education needs to build the foundation upon which individuals can build the financial lives they wish to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep the idea of skill or capability as a guiding principle. Knowledge of the difference among investment types is nice but evaluating those differences is essential. The skills can be used in changing situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many tools that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help. There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day. There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy the bigger difference we can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum in which we present may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always enhance financial literacy education in schools by making it experiential. That is what people will most carry forward; that is where the difference is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perusing social media might lead you to believe that frugality is the essence of financial literacy. Not necessarily. Frugal people rarely own airplanes or yachts. The 47 percent of Americans who are financially literate and budget-conscious, according to Harris Insights and Analytics, very well might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frugal people focus on not wasting money — on minimizing their expenses. This can be difficult for low-income households to manage thanks to liquidity restraints, according to a report in the Journal of Marketing Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though those low-income households stand to benefit the most from frugal strategies, such as the ability to buy in bulk, they are unfortunately unable to put those strategies into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people, on the other hand, understand the consequences of their financial decisions and act accordingly. They use financial resources intentionally. Financially literate people focus on making good money decisions. And the best decision often isn’t the most frugal one.&lt;/p&gt;
Living Within Your Means
&lt;p&gt;The common ground between frugality and financial literacy is living within your means. But the two approaches are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of doing well financially, living within one’s means requires that the sum of one’s expenses and savings must be at or below one’s income. This principle transcends both ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially successful, one has to live within one’s means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “means equation” says that we get to spend no more than we make. The frugality camp focuses on minimizing the expenses side of the equation. Unfortunately, neglecting the revenue side can be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
Reducing Expenses vs. Increasing Revenue
&lt;p&gt;It should be fairly apparent that there’s more room to change the revenue side of the equation than the expense side — at least theoretically. Changes to the expense side of the equation are limited to the total of the expenses — you can’t reduce your expenses beyond zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revenue side does not have this barrier. The revenue side is, theoretically, infinitely changeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get Matched With a Financial Adviser Most Suited to Your Unique Needs Maximize Your Retirement Efforts Today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a variety of challenges when it comes to making dramatic increases in the revenue side of the equation. This is especially true in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing one’s income can take a lot of time and hard work. It can also require you to make an intermediate investment, such as getting training or education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, frugality — much like laziness — pays off immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is frugality’s great benefit. Frugality as a tool can help us to navigate times of low income, such as a period of unemployment. Frugality can also help us to push out additional savings to meet a short-term goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually, a frugal lifestyle often burns us out. Living “without” robs us of many simple pleasures. It robs us of the emotional peace of enjoying simple things because it makes us believe that we’re bad for wasting money on ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
Frugality vs. Financial Literacy: The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;In the long term, we need to tell frugality to pound salt. We need to understand that our self-worth is not equal to the number of pennies saved, and we will buy that damn ice cream if we want. Some of those little expenses contribute to self-care, which is important for our mental and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy — making informed and intentional financial decisions — allows us to do what we want, if we’re willing. If we’re willing to understand the ramifications of our decisions, then the sky’s the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the sea’s the limit, depending on whether you picked the airplane or the yacht. It’s all about decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, you can have anything that you’re willing to earn and build for. Or you can spend less and have what’s left over. Frugality is a tool. Financial literacy is the whole tool set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ball is in your court. Choose wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leslie Tayne always knew she wanted to be a lawyer despite her father warning her when she started 20 years ago that it truly was a boys club.&lt;/p&gt;

With a focus on financial wellness and working with their clients as a team, Tayne’s group points clients in the right direction, even if it’s outside their practice. She wants to do what is in their best financial interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to save money on groceries, I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I did stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not a chef, and it’s engineered to give your body everything you need to function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone, and — in theory — should still lead a perfectly normal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing your lifestyle to this extent isn’t as abnormal as you may think. In the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion, according to IBISWorld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Time Is Money
&lt;p&gt;The Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn’t about money — it was about time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think I’m being stingy with my time, but I’m young. Think of all the time I would save by not having to cook. That would effectively add months to my life! I also wouldn’t have to grocery shop very often (never, really). Soylent can be delivered to my door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason I found it so appealing was for health reasons. Stay with me, because I’m about to get pretty holistic about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love automation. Automation means you can set something good in motion and have it run without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can do awesome things without constant motivation. Think automatic bill pay or 401(k) contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Soylent, I’m constantly having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day. That means I’m having to consciously make healthy choices three-plus times per day, so I sometimes don’t eat as healthy as I should. With Soylent, I can be healthy without having to worry about the ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I wouldn’t replace all my meals with Soylent. But many of my boring meals would get replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
Vacation Meals on a Budget
&lt;p&gt;The final reason Soylent caught my eye is the cost. Prices vary based on the amount and whether it’s in bottled or powder form for you to mix, but it’s around $3 per bottle, or $3 per meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though that’s more expensive than most home-cooked meals, it saves a lot of money when traveling or just being out and about. Instead of needing to buy a meal, you can just pull a bottle out of your backpack or purse, and crack it open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Chris: “Purple Carrot delivers a box with three vegan meals to prepare a week. The best part is that it comes with a little cookbook each time. I just buy the ingredients later on if I want to make a recipe again. It got me out of a rut of making me the same stuff…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuart: “I make my own chicken broth from store-bought rotisserie chickens. I hate using fresh onion, carrot or celery just for broth. I developed the habit of taking scraps of the three when I cook and storing them in a container in the freezer. When I need to make broth, I just dump it into my instant pot with my chicken. Saves time and money.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teresa: “Pay attention to how often your favorite products go on sale and stock up on enough to last you until the next cycle. There is a fairly predictable sales cycle.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrick: “Instant Pot. Two magic words.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tonia: “If you have the space, get a big box or upright extra freezer. Make massive batches of dishes like taco meat, slow-cooked pork, pot roast, Indian curry, rice dishes of any kind, etc. Batch them into containers so there’s no cooking during the week. We do this and order in once a week. We keep fresh broccoli, string beans and cauliflower in large Tupperware containers pre-cut and cleaned and quickly pan-fry or steam them in minutes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lisa: “Instacart. Restaurant Depot allows you to order from them to your home since the pandemic started. It’s basically Costco for restaurants.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arindam: “1-800-DIY.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kristen: “HelloFresh has saved me the headache of what to make and shopping for ingredients.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diane: “Make a big batch of pasta sauce or chili on Sunday, freeze some and eat some throughout the week.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
          
The Start of a New Diet
&lt;p&gt;I ordered my first round of Soylent a month ago straight from the website. The package arrived three days later. I opened the box and inside were a dozen white plastic bottles with black caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited to try one until the next day — I wanted to start with an empty stomach so I could get the full effect. That morning, I tried my first sip. It was oddly delicious. I was surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is designed to have a neutral flavor so that the consumer doesn’t get sick of the taste. But still, it was slightly sweet. Soylent subtly smells and tastes of a graham cracker and looks like a light cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;
An Epic Diet Fail
&lt;p&gt;About 20 minutes later, I felt like I had the flu. I ate some “real” food and the flu-like symptoms disappeared. I tried more Soylent the next day. Same reaction. I tried two more times — same reaction again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drank part of one right before doing 45 minutes of a cardio workout to check my energy levels. Exercising with the actual flu would’ve been easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Googled my symptoms. My reaction was very rare. It’s most likely the vanillin flavoring was to blame. And with that, my Soylent diet journey came to an abrupt end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my experience is negative, I still recommend you give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my mom, dad, and cousin to drink Soylent, and they all really enjoyed it. At least they can save time, enjoy better health, and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll continue my quest for a meal replacement beverage. So long, Soylent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Sullivan, director of communication at Soylent, says: “We know many people use our products to save both time and money and are able to do so successfully. However, we do not recommend anyone switching to a Soylent only diet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we always recommend everyone connect with their doctor or dietitian to decide the best overall meal plan to support your personal health goals and nutrition plan,” Sullivan adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentSai does not recommend changing your lifestyle or dietary habits without consulting your physician.&lt;/p&gt;

]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>80405</guid><title>The Best Methodologies for Teaching Financial Literacy</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy continues to make slow strides in gaining attention, while discussions of appropriate methodologies in a school setting remain scant. The lack of sufficient attention to methodology has hindered progress; many programs lack meaningful evaluation and longitudinal studies are few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a circular problem: It is difficult to get support to expand programs when there is a lack of verifiable evidence of their effectiveness, which makes it more difficult to move forward and gain that evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A saving grace is the vast need for financial literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and people are visibly getting left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Financial Literacy Mandates
&lt;p&gt;There continues to be slow progress in the number of states requiring some form of personal financial literacy education as a high school graduation requirement. It’s now about half, which is significant, but it is clearly not where we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few states, however, require students to take a stand-alone course in personal finance. More require personal finance education integrated with other coursework. Mandates are great, but they don’t mean that it actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is concerning to see young people graduating high school barely able to read or write; there can be little confidence that they somehow attained reasonable financial literacy education while missing out on reading in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mandates are not always being followed. Schools face many challenges, and states aren’t going to push very hard on getting those who can’t read to be good with money. They probably feel they have bigger problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State financial literacy education mandates in schools are important but not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
The Feedback Challenge
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy education should make a lifetime of difference. All too often results are either not measured or measured at a point in time. And the focus tends to be on knowledge alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is important, but financial literacy is a skill; you need to apply it and use it to develop the skill. You learn skills through practicing with knowledge — both knowledge and experience are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a lot like welding — you can read a bunch of books but that does not make you competent with a torch. You need both knowledge and experience to be a good welder, as you need both knowledge and experience to be competent at any skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t matter if it is baking or flying or financial literacy, knowledge does little without experience, and experience can be an expensive and dangerous teacher in the absence of knowledge. They are inseparable; neither has meaningful value alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a classroom, there are options to develop the skills of financial literacy, just as you would with welding or baking. Financial literacy skills can be developed with cases and games, with interactive tools and with competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands-on training provides the learner with a feedback loop. They take an action and a consequence develops. Knowledge training without an experiential component is better than nothing, but it cannot compete with experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ideal situation is directly hands on. Games are a great substitute, but not the only option. Case studies, learning from stories and critiquing the actions of others, even simple exercises can add a hands-on component to knowledge training and improve the likelihood of long-term improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge has the singular advantage of being easy to test and evaluate. Assessments can measure knowledge gains whereas skill development is harder to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
Program Elements
&lt;p&gt;Effective financial literacy education needs to develop several skills. Some are overlooked in knowledge-based programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially literate, you need to be able to evaluate financial alternatives. This can be useful in day-to-day activities like comparison shopping and is essential for major purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people should be able to compare mortgage options and make a reasonable choice based on their situation and should be able to evaluate choices like leasing a car versus buying a car. Financial decision-making is an essential financial literacy skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using technology in finance is important and growing in importance. There are fantastic tools available to assist individuals in a myriad of financial challenges. But using powerful tools without knowledge of the consequences can be a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to not only know how to use technology — that’s the easy part — but they also need to know when to use technology and what the potential risks are. It is too easy to invest in risky investments with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can experience negative consequences without even knowing the consequences were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology can be wonderful and powerful, or it can be crippling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud awareness and preventing it needs to be an element of a good financial education. It has been bad out there, and it is getting worse. People need to know how to protect themselves, and where to find out what to watch for as the bad people get better at what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Behavioral Finance
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral finance can no longer be ignored. In school, individuals need to learn about the behavioral aspects of financial literacy and how to deal with the biggest obstacle they will face on their journey to financial success: themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is an emotional topic. Emotions can cause people to make suboptimal decisions. Car dealers know this. You should too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to learn about the risks behavior brings to the table — and how to combat those risks. There must be proactive to solutions to deal with our human tendencies, which do not serve us well as long-term accumulators. The more we understand and are aware of our own shortcomings the greater our ability to overcome them and achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets and volatility are not what holds investors back; behaviors in the face of market conditions and volatility are what holds investors back. Behavioral finance is an essential component of financial literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
Systems Thinking
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy can benefit from systems thinking. Nothing occurs without impacting other things. This is as true in financial matters as it is in any other system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you increase your 401(k) contributions, for example, it impacts not only your retirement preparedness, but also your cash flow and your taxes and may impact other areas of your financial life. Any single change has the potential for multiple consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, financial literacy and financial matters occur within larger systems. An individual’s numeracy skills are a codeterminant of their financial capability. Those with low numeracy skills are more likely to struggle financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numeracy education is not financial education, but supports financial education. Those challenged by numeracy need to gain knowledge of and comfort with other tools to assist with numeracy.&lt;/p&gt;
Talk It to Death
&lt;p&gt;A major aim of basic financial literacy programs is to raise awareness while developing rudimentary skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can help. We can help in our families and we can help in our workplaces. And we can help by simply talking it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can and should talk about financial matters at home. We should talk about budgets and we should talk about the process of evaluating financial alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children who grow up in a home where the parents smoke are more likely to smoke; children who grow up in homes where the parents demonstrate financial awareness and restraint are similarly more likely to pick up these habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t demonstrate the habits you don’t want the kids to pick up, and repeat the habits you would like them to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us can talk up financial literacy at work. We can be advocates for the 401(k) or other retirement plans. We can be advocates for debt reduction and we can be advocates for emergency funds and we can be advocates for budgets. And we can do that without being obnoxious. People don’t like to be told what to do, but they do love stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a passion for financial literacy or financial wellness, you can share that passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be surprised not only by how many people are interested, but also that they will make changes and be excited to tell you of their own progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk it up. Stories are a very powerful teaching tool. Talk it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;There is no silver bullet for financial illiteracy. Amazing things are happening, but we still have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy is a complex skill and we can spend a lifetime continually learning new things. But we won’t if we don’t have a solid start. Financial literacy education needs to build the foundation upon which individuals can build the financial lives they wish to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep the idea of skill or capability as a guiding principle. Knowledge of the difference among investment types is nice but evaluating those differences is essential. The skills can be used in changing situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many tools that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help. There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day. There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy the bigger difference we can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum in which we present may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always enhance financial literacy education in schools by making it experiential. That is what people will most carry forward; that is where the difference is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>If you increase your 401(k) contributions, for example, it impacts not only your retirement preparedness, but also your cash flow and your taxes and may impact other areas of your financial life. Any single change has the potential for multiple consequences.</p>
<p>Likewise, financial literacy and financial matters occur within larger systems. An individual’s numeracy skills are a codeterminant of their financial capability. Those with low numeracy skills are more likely to struggle financially.</p>
<p>Numeracy education is not financial education, but supports financial education. Those challenged by numeracy need to gain knowledge of and comfort with other tools to assist with numeracy.</p>
Talk It to Death
<p>A major aim of basic financial literacy programs is to raise awareness while developing rudimentary skills.</p>
<p>We can help. We can help in our families and we can help in our workplaces. And we can help by simply talking it to death.</p>
<p>We can and should talk about financial matters at home. We should talk about budgets and we should talk about the process of evaluating financial alternatives.</p>
<p>Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents</p>
<p>Children who grow up in a home where the parents smoke are more likely to smoke; children who grow up in homes where the parents demonstrate financial awareness and restraint are similarly more likely to pick up these habits.</p>
<p>Don’t demonstrate the habits you don’t want the kids to pick up, and repeat the habits you would like them to obtain.</p>
<p>Many of us can talk up financial literacy at work. We can be advocates for the 401(k) or other retirement plans. We can be advocates for debt reduction and we can be advocates for emergency funds and we can be advocates for budgets. And we can do that without being obnoxious. People don’t like to be told what to do, but they do love stories.</p>
<p>If you have a passion for financial literacy or financial wellness, you can share that passion.</p>
<p>You may be surprised not only by how many people are interested, but also that they will make changes and be excited to tell you of their own progress.</p>
<p>Talk it up. Stories are a very powerful teaching tool. Talk it to death.</p>
The Bottom Line
<p>There is no silver bullet for financial illiteracy. Amazing things are happening, but we still have a long way to go.</p>
<p>Financial literacy is a complex skill and we can spend a lifetime continually learning new things. But we won’t if we don’t have a solid start. Financial literacy education needs to build the foundation upon which individuals can build the financial lives they wish to have.</p>
<p>We need to keep the idea of skill or capability as a guiding principle. Knowledge of the difference among investment types is nice but evaluating those differences is essential. The skills can be used in changing situations.</p>
<p>There are many tools that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help. There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day. There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy the bigger difference we can make.</p>
<p>The forum in which we present may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always enhance financial literacy education in schools by making it experiential. That is what people will most carry forward; that is where the difference is made.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Perusing social media might lead you to believe that frugality is the essence of financial literacy. Not necessarily. Frugal people rarely own airplanes or yachts. The 47 percent of Americans who are financially literate and budget-conscious, according to Harris Insights and Analytics, very well might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frugal people focus on not wasting money — on minimizing their expenses. This can be difficult for low-income households to manage thanks to liquidity restraints, according to a report in the Journal of Marketing Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though those low-income households stand to benefit the most from frugal strategies, such as the ability to buy in bulk, they are unfortunately unable to put those strategies into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people, on the other hand, understand the consequences of their financial decisions and act accordingly. They use financial resources intentionally. Financially literate people focus on making good money decisions. And the best decision often isn’t the most frugal one.&lt;/p&gt;
Living Within Your Means
&lt;p&gt;The common ground between frugality and financial literacy is living within your means. But the two approaches are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of doing well financially, living within one’s means requires that the sum of one’s expenses and savings must be at or below one’s income. This principle transcends both ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially successful, one has to live within one’s means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “means equation” says that we get to spend no more than we make. The frugality camp focuses on minimizing the expenses side of the equation. Unfortunately, neglecting the revenue side can be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
Reducing Expenses vs. Increasing Revenue
&lt;p&gt;It should be fairly apparent that there’s more room to change the revenue side of the equation than the expense side — at least theoretically. Changes to the expense side of the equation are limited to the total of the expenses — you can’t reduce your expenses beyond zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revenue side does not have this barrier. The revenue side is, theoretically, infinitely changeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get Matched With a Financial Adviser Most Suited to Your Unique Needs Maximize Your Retirement Efforts Today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a variety of challenges when it comes to making dramatic increases in the revenue side of the equation. This is especially true in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing one’s income can take a lot of time and hard work. It can also require you to make an intermediate investment, such as getting training or education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, frugality — much like laziness — pays off immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is frugality’s great benefit. Frugality as a tool can help us to navigate times of low income, such as a period of unemployment. Frugality can also help us to push out additional savings to meet a short-term goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually, a frugal lifestyle often burns us out. Living “without” robs us of many simple pleasures. It robs us of the emotional peace of enjoying simple things because it makes us believe that we’re bad for wasting money on ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
Frugality vs. Financial Literacy: The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;In the long term, we need to tell frugality to pound salt. We need to understand that our self-worth is not equal to the number of pennies saved, and we will buy that damn ice cream if we want. Some of those little expenses contribute to self-care, which is important for our mental and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy — making informed and intentional financial decisions — allows us to do what we want, if we’re willing. If we’re willing to understand the ramifications of our decisions, then the sky’s the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the sea’s the limit, depending on whether you picked the airplane or the yacht. It’s all about decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, you can have anything that you’re willing to earn and build for. Or you can spend less and have what’s left over. Frugality is a tool. Financial literacy is the whole tool set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ball is in your court. Choose wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to save money on groceries, I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I did stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not a chef, and it’s engineered to give your body everything you need to function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone, and — in theory — should still lead a perfectly normal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing your lifestyle to this extent isn’t as abnormal as you may think. In the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion, according to IBISWorld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Time Is Money
&lt;p&gt;The Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn’t about money — it was about time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think I’m being stingy with my time, but I’m young. Think of all the time I would save by not having to cook. That would effectively add months to my life! I also wouldn’t have to grocery shop very often (never, really). Soylent can be delivered to my door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason I found it so appealing was for health reasons. Stay with me, because I’m about to get pretty holistic about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love automation. Automation means you can set something good in motion and have it run without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can do awesome things without constant motivation. Think automatic bill pay or 401(k) contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Soylent, I’m constantly having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day. That means I’m having to consciously make healthy choices three-plus times per day, so I sometimes don’t eat as healthy as I should. With Soylent, I can be healthy without having to worry about the ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I wouldn’t replace all my meals with Soylent. But many of my boring meals would get replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
Vacation Meals on a Budget
&lt;p&gt;The final reason Soylent caught my eye is the cost. Prices vary based on the amount and whether it’s in bottled or powder form for you to mix, but it’s around $3 per bottle, or $3 per meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though that’s more expensive than most home-cooked meals, it saves a lot of money when traveling or just being out and about. Instead of needing to buy a meal, you can just pull a bottle out of your backpack or purse, and crack it open.&lt;/p&gt;

			Food Hacks That Save Our Readers Time and Money
            &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris: “Purple Carrot delivers a box with three vegan meals to prepare a week. The best part is that it comes with a little cookbook each time. I just buy the ingredients later on if I want to make a recipe again. It got me out of a rut of making me the same stuff…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuart: “I make my own chicken broth from store-bought rotisserie chickens. I hate using fresh onion, carrot or celery just for broth. I developed the habit of taking scraps of the three when I cook and storing them in a container in the freezer. When I need to make broth, I just dump it into my instant pot with my chicken. Saves time and money.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teresa: “Pay attention to how often your favorite products go on sale and stock up on enough to last you until the next cycle. There is a fairly predictable sales cycle.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrick: “Instant Pot. Two magic words.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tonia: “If you have the space, get a big box or upright extra freezer. Make massive batches of dishes like taco meat, slow-cooked pork, pot roast, Indian curry, rice dishes of any kind, etc. Batch them into containers so there’s no cooking during the week. We do this and order in once a week. We keep fresh broccoli, string beans and cauliflower in large Tupperware containers pre-cut and cleaned and quickly pan-fry or steam them in minutes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lisa: “Instacart. Restaurant Depot allows you to order from them to your home since the pandemic started. It’s basically Costco for restaurants.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arindam: “1-800-DIY.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kristen: “HelloFresh has saved me the headache of what to make and shopping for ingredients.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diane: “Make a big batch of pasta sauce or chili on Sunday, freeze some and eat some throughout the week.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
          
The Start of a New Diet
&lt;p&gt;I ordered my first round of Soylent a month ago straight from the website. The package arrived three days later. I opened the box and inside were a dozen white plastic bottles with black caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited to try one until the next day — I wanted to start with an empty stomach so I could get the full effect. That morning, I tried my first sip. It was oddly delicious. I was surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is designed to have a neutral flavor so that the consumer doesn’t get sick of the taste. But still, it was slightly sweet. Soylent subtly smells and tastes of a graham cracker and looks like a light cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;
An Epic Diet Fail
&lt;p&gt;About 20 minutes later, I felt like I had the flu. I ate some “real” food and the flu-like symptoms disappeared. I tried more Soylent the next day. Same reaction. I tried two more times — same reaction again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drank part of one right before doing 45 minutes of a cardio workout to check my energy levels. Exercising with the actual flu would’ve been easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Googled my symptoms. My reaction was very rare. It’s most likely the vanillin flavoring was to blame. And with that, my Soylent diet journey came to an abrupt end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my experience is negative, I still recommend you give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my mom, dad, and cousin to drink Soylent, and they all really enjoyed it. At least they can save time, enjoy better health, and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll continue my quest for a meal replacement beverage. So long, Soylent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Sullivan, director of communication at Soylent, says: “We know many people use our products to save both time and money and are able to do so successfully. However, we do not recommend anyone switching to a Soylent only diet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we always recommend everyone connect with their doctor or dietitian to decide the best overall meal plan to support your personal health goals and nutrition plan,” Sullivan adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentSai does not recommend changing your lifestyle or dietary habits without consulting your physician.&lt;/p&gt;

]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>80405</guid><title>The Best Methodologies for Teaching Financial Literacy</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy continues to make slow strides in gaining attention, while discussions of appropriate methodologies in a school setting remain scant. The lack of sufficient attention to methodology has hindered progress; many programs lack meaningful evaluation and longitudinal studies are few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a circular problem: It is difficult to get support to expand programs when there is a lack of verifiable evidence of their effectiveness, which makes it more difficult to move forward and gain that evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A saving grace is the vast need for financial literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and people are visibly getting left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Financial Literacy Mandates
&lt;p&gt;There continues to be slow progress in the number of states requiring some form of personal financial literacy education as a high school graduation requirement. It’s now about half, which is significant, but it is clearly not where we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few states, however, require students to take a stand-alone course in personal finance. More require personal finance education integrated with other coursework. Mandates are great, but they don’t mean that it actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is concerning to see young people graduating high school barely able to read or write; there can be little confidence that they somehow attained reasonable financial literacy education while missing out on reading in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mandates are not always being followed. Schools face many challenges, and states aren’t going to push very hard on getting those who can’t read to be good with money. They probably feel they have bigger problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State financial literacy education mandates in schools are important but not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
The Feedback Challenge
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy education should make a lifetime of difference. All too often results are either not measured or measured at a point in time. And the focus tends to be on knowledge alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is important, but financial literacy is a skill; you need to apply it and use it to develop the skill. You learn skills through practicing with knowledge — both knowledge and experience are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a lot like welding — you can read a bunch of books but that does not make you competent with a torch. You need both knowledge and experience to be a good welder, as you need both knowledge and experience to be competent at any skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t matter if it is baking or flying or financial literacy, knowledge does little without experience, and experience can be an expensive and dangerous teacher in the absence of knowledge. They are inseparable; neither has meaningful value alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a classroom, there are options to develop the skills of financial literacy, just as you would with welding or baking. Financial literacy skills can be developed with cases and games, with interactive tools and with competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands-on training provides the learner with a feedback loop. They take an action and a consequence develops. Knowledge training without an experiential component is better than nothing, but it cannot compete with experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ideal situation is directly hands on. Games are a great substitute, but not the only option. Case studies, learning from stories and critiquing the actions of others, even simple exercises can add a hands-on component to knowledge training and improve the likelihood of long-term improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge has the singular advantage of being easy to test and evaluate. Assessments can measure knowledge gains whereas skill development is harder to evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
Program Elements
&lt;p&gt;Effective financial literacy education needs to develop several skills. Some are overlooked in knowledge-based programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially literate, you need to be able to evaluate financial alternatives. This can be useful in day-to-day activities like comparison shopping and is essential for major purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people should be able to compare mortgage options and make a reasonable choice based on their situation and should be able to evaluate choices like leasing a car versus buying a car. Financial decision-making is an essential financial literacy skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using technology in finance is important and growing in importance. There are fantastic tools available to assist individuals in a myriad of financial challenges. But using powerful tools without knowledge of the consequences can be a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to not only know how to use technology — that’s the easy part — but they also need to know when to use technology and what the potential risks are. It is too easy to invest in risky investments with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can experience negative consequences without even knowing the consequences were possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology can be wonderful and powerful, or it can be crippling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud awareness and preventing it needs to be an element of a good financial education. It has been bad out there, and it is getting worse. People need to know how to protect themselves, and where to find out what to watch for as the bad people get better at what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Behavioral Finance
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral finance can no longer be ignored. In school, individuals need to learn about the behavioral aspects of financial literacy and how to deal with the biggest obstacle they will face on their journey to financial success: themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is an emotional topic. Emotions can cause people to make suboptimal decisions. Car dealers know this. You should too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students need to learn about the risks behavior brings to the table — and how to combat those risks. There must be proactive to solutions to deal with our human tendencies, which do not serve us well as long-term accumulators. The more we understand and are aware of our own shortcomings the greater our ability to overcome them and achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets and volatility are not what holds investors back; behaviors in the face of market conditions and volatility are what holds investors back. Behavioral finance is an essential component of financial literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
Systems Thinking
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy can benefit from systems thinking. Nothing occurs without impacting other things. This is as true in financial matters as it is in any other system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you increase your 401(k) contributions, for example, it impacts not only your retirement preparedness, but also your cash flow and your taxes and may impact other areas of your financial life. Any single change has the potential for multiple consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, financial literacy and financial matters occur within larger systems. An individual’s numeracy skills are a codeterminant of their financial capability. Those with low numeracy skills are more likely to struggle financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numeracy education is not financial education, but supports financial education. Those challenged by numeracy need to gain knowledge of and comfort with other tools to assist with numeracy.&lt;/p&gt;
Talk It to Death
&lt;p&gt;A major aim of basic financial literacy programs is to raise awareness while developing rudimentary skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can help. We can help in our families and we can help in our workplaces. And we can help by simply talking it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can and should talk about financial matters at home. We should talk about budgets and we should talk about the process of evaluating financial alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising Financially-Smart Kids Made Easy An App that can be Managed by Parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children who grow up in a home where the parents smoke are more likely to smoke; children who grow up in homes where the parents demonstrate financial awareness and restraint are similarly more likely to pick up these habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t demonstrate the habits you don’t want the kids to pick up, and repeat the habits you would like them to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us can talk up financial literacy at work. We can be advocates for the 401(k) or other retirement plans. We can be advocates for debt reduction and we can be advocates for emergency funds and we can be advocates for budgets. And we can do that without being obnoxious. People don’t like to be told what to do, but they do love stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a passion for financial literacy or financial wellness, you can share that passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be surprised not only by how many people are interested, but also that they will make changes and be excited to tell you of their own progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk it up. Stories are a very powerful teaching tool. Talk it to death.&lt;/p&gt;
The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;There is no silver bullet for financial illiteracy. Amazing things are happening, but we still have a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy is a complex skill and we can spend a lifetime continually learning new things. But we won’t if we don’t have a solid start. Financial literacy education needs to build the foundation upon which individuals can build the financial lives they wish to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep the idea of skill or capability as a guiding principle. Knowledge of the difference among investment types is nice but evaluating those differences is essential. The skills can be used in changing situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many tools that can be used to enhance skill-building. Technology continues to help. There are more great videos and simulations and games available every day. There is a lot of power in stories. The more we can talk up financial literacy the bigger difference we can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum in which we present may constrain the techniques or methodologies we can use, but we can always enhance financial literacy education in schools by making it experiential. That is what people will most carry forward; that is where the difference is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Financial literacy continues to make slow strides in gaining attention, while discussions of appropriate methodologies in a school setting remain scant. The lack of sufficient attention to methodology has hindered progress; many programs lack meaningful evaluation and longitudinal studies are few.</p>
<p>This creates a circular problem: It is difficult to get support to expand programs when there is a lack of verifiable evidence of their effectiveness, which makes it more difficult to move forward and gain that evidence.</p>
<p>A saving grace is the vast need for financial literacy. Despite sufficient evidence of effectiveness, there is a growing body of evidence of need. Real people are suffering the consequences of financial illiteracy every day. The financial world continues to get more complex and people are visibly getting left behind.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Perusing social media might lead you to believe that frugality is the essence of financial literacy. Not necessarily. Frugal people rarely own airplanes or yachts. The 47 percent of Americans who are financially literate and budget-conscious, according to Harris Insights and Analytics, very well might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frugal people focus on not wasting money — on minimizing their expenses. This can be difficult for low-income households to manage thanks to liquidity restraints, according to a report in the Journal of Marketing Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though those low-income households stand to benefit the most from frugal strategies, such as the ability to buy in bulk, they are unfortunately unable to put those strategies into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially literate people, on the other hand, understand the consequences of their financial decisions and act accordingly. They use financial resources intentionally. Financially literate people focus on making good money decisions. And the best decision often isn’t the most frugal one.&lt;/p&gt;
Living Within Your Means
&lt;p&gt;The common ground between frugality and financial literacy is living within your means. But the two approaches are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of doing well financially, living within one’s means requires that the sum of one’s expenses and savings must be at or below one’s income. This principle transcends both ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be financially successful, one has to live within one’s means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “means equation” says that we get to spend no more than we make. The frugality camp focuses on minimizing the expenses side of the equation. Unfortunately, neglecting the revenue side can be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
Reducing Expenses vs. Increasing Revenue
&lt;p&gt;It should be fairly apparent that there’s more room to change the revenue side of the equation than the expense side — at least theoretically. Changes to the expense side of the equation are limited to the total of the expenses — you can’t reduce your expenses beyond zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revenue side does not have this barrier. The revenue side is, theoretically, infinitely changeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get Matched With a Financial Adviser Most Suited to Your Unique Needs Maximize Your Retirement Efforts Today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a variety of challenges when it comes to making dramatic increases in the revenue side of the equation. This is especially true in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing one’s income can take a lot of time and hard work. It can also require you to make an intermediate investment, such as getting training or education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, frugality — much like laziness — pays off immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is frugality’s great benefit. Frugality as a tool can help us to navigate times of low income, such as a period of unemployment. Frugality can also help us to push out additional savings to meet a short-term goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually, a frugal lifestyle often burns us out. Living “without” robs us of many simple pleasures. It robs us of the emotional peace of enjoying simple things because it makes us believe that we’re bad for wasting money on ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
Frugality vs. Financial Literacy: The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;In the long term, we need to tell frugality to pound salt. We need to understand that our self-worth is not equal to the number of pennies saved, and we will buy that damn ice cream if we want. Some of those little expenses contribute to self-care, which is important for our mental and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial literacy — making informed and intentional financial decisions — allows us to do what we want, if we’re willing. If we’re willing to understand the ramifications of our decisions, then the sky’s the limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the sea’s the limit, depending on whether you picked the airplane or the yacht. It’s all about decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, you can have anything that you’re willing to earn and build for. Or you can spend less and have what’s left over. Frugality is a tool. Financial literacy is the whole tool set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ball is in your court. Choose wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leslie Tayne always knew she wanted to be a lawyer despite her father warning her when she started 20 years ago that it truly was a boys club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the best business ideas are right in front of you. That was the case for Ashley Clark, who pivoted from being a banker to an entrepreneur and creator of old-school board games and flashcards that teach financial literacy — going against the current trend of online gaming with six-figure success during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial planning is often pictured in graphic images as an upwardly sloping straight-line path that moves seamlessly from Point A to Point B. People set financial goals, develop a plan, “work the plan” by taking action to reach their goals, and review and revise the plan every so often or when major lifestyle changes occur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this approach can sometimes work well in normal times, the past year has been anything but normal as a result of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many personal financial plans (e.g., jobs, education, moving, travel, retirement dates) “blew up” amid layoffs, lockdowns, deaths of loved ones, and lives fraught with uncertainty. In addition, legislation and the law of supply and demand (i.e., the current U.S. housing market) presented opportunities that nobody could have foreseen, much less planned for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better graphic image for the financial planning process for many people, especially during the past year, is a tangled ball of yarn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five examples are presented, below, of “accidental” financial planning opportunities that were not on most people’s radar screens until recently. They could not have been included in personal financial plans previously because they were not feasible, not applicable, or did not exist under previous tax laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these strategies have arisen in some way, shape, or form as a result of the pandemic and may be useful to consider during the months ahead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Deploy Tax Savings From Unemployment Tax Leniency&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), signed into law on March 12, many taxpayers are exempt from income tax on up to $10,200 of unemployment benefits that were received during 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, this money would be fully taxable as ordinary income (i.e., at a taxpayer’s regular marginal tax rate, like wages, salaries, and tips) on federal tax returns. This tax break was a last-minute addition to the ARPA that few people saw coming and came a month into the 2020 tax filing season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people probably had taxes withheld on their unemployment benefits or sent the IRS quarterly estimated payments in expectation of a future tax liability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the ARPA tax law change, those individuals could now save $1,000 or more on their income taxes (depending on their tax rate and other income sources), resulting in a larger refund or a smaller tax bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, $9,000 in unemployment benefits in the 12 percent tax bracket = $1,080 (9,000 x .12). This is a nice chunk of change to save or repay debt with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Take Tax Credits Available as a Result of Reduced Income&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some taxpayers may qualify for income tax breaks in 2020 for which they previously earned too much income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which maxes out at $15,280 ($21,710) of adjusted gross income (AGI) for a single taxpayer and married couple filing jointly with no children and $41,756 ($47, 646), $47, 440 ($53,330), and $50,594 ($56,844) with one, two, and three or more children, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximum credit amounts on 2020 tax returns for zero, one, two, and three or more children are respectively $538, $3,584, $5,920, and $6,660. A tax credit is a dollar for dollar reduction in tax liability (e.g., $6,000 tentative tax bill minus $3,584 EITC = $2,416 final tax bill). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time ever, perhaps, taxpayers who always earned more than the maximum AGI for the EITC may qualify if they lost income as a result of the pandemic. The tax savings could provide funds for an emergency fund or debt repayment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Use a Big House Profit to Pay Off Accumulated Debt&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some homeowners who lost income and got behind on mortgage payments are cashing out during the current “red hot” housing market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one case that I know of, a home seller who owes over $18,000 in arrearages on a federally backed FHA mortgage and has no money with which to repay it when the foreclosure moratorium expires on June 30 will make about a $60,000 profit as a result of selling the house in a bidding war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After paying back the mortgage arrearage and home selling expenses, the seller will walk away with about $20,000 after less than two years of homeownership and will “punt back” to apartment living until household finances stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Use a Big House Profit and Downsizing to Build a Retirement Nest Egg&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, people who planned to move and downsize anyway and lack sufficient retirement savings can benefit from selling their home in the current sellers’ market and moving to something smaller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They essentially become cash buyers who are better able to compete for new housing in the area where they live or elsewhere. In addition, the spread between their old home’s price and the cost of a new one provides income for future living expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, $300,000 of home sale profit placed in a balanced mutual fund with a 6 percent average return will throw off about $18,000 of annual income.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Increase Savings and Philanthropy&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Americans have experienced financial silver linings that they could have not anticipated as a result of COVID-19: increased income due to demand for their industry sector or work skills and/or reduced expenses such as commuting costs, child care, and other expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like home sale profit and income tax breaks, increased cash flow provides an opportunity for increased savings, debt reduction, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also new opportunities for philanthropy. On 2020 tax returns, married couples filing jointly or singles who do not itemize can deduct $300 in cash contributions to qualified charities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, the tax write-off for couples increases to $600. In addition, the 60 percent of AGI cap on donations made by itemizing taxpayers is suspended in 2021 to encourage philanthropy for coronavirus relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiny homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just saying the name brings to mind images of adorable rolling cottages, cutting-edge lifestyles, and minimal possessions and worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve all seen the TV shows, listened to the podcasts, and fantasized a bit about living in a home in the forest or on a plot of land near a creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those saddled with debt, the idea of a tiny home that costs less than $20,000 sounds like a great idea. Buying a standard house means spending money on a down payment, insurance, interest, and taxes, not to mention maintenance over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The down payment alone is an extreme obstacle to 62 percent of millennials who would not be able to afford a home, according to a survey by Apartment List, while an additional 29 percent claim that the monthly payments would be a severe financial burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This begs the question: Given their low cost, are tiny homes good investments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much does living the “tiny life” actually cost, and what kind of resale value can you expect from owning a tiny house?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
What Are Tiny Homes?
&lt;p&gt;In a few words, the tiny home movement is an effort to combat the prevalence of McMansions. It’s about reducing the size of the space you live in, meaning that many tiny homes are under 500 square feet. They can be made from vans, miniature constructions, or even from storage containers that real estate entrepreneurs like Janelle Briggs provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, there are more than 10,000 tiny homes, according to Go Downsize, and the trend seems to be rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiny-home dwellers may downsize for a variety of reasons — environmental concerns, financial difficulties, or simply for flexibility and freedom. Many tiny homes are mobile, so you can take them wherever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
What Kind of Investment Is a Tiny Home?
&lt;p&gt;One of the things people love most about tiny homes is their endless customizability, which also makes it difficult to answer the question of how much tiny homes cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that they are easily personalized, this makes it difficult to find an average price for tiny homes, as size, materials, and finishes can vary greatly. The figure runs from about $8,000 for a DIY tiny home with minimal fixtures all the way up to $150,000 and beyond for a custom-built tiny home with luxe fittings and features, according to Home Advisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest factors in pricing out a tiny home are materials and labor costs. Anyone who’s worked with a contractor can tell you that those items aren’t cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re willing to do a large portion of the work yourself, you can significantly lower the cost of your home. When looking at a tiny home as an investment, you have to put a dollar value on your own labor. This tells you the real cost, in both money and time spent, of building one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials are the next largest pricing factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re savvy and willing to spend some time researching, you can often find reclaimed materials or leftovers from a job site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are entire stores that sell nothing but the extra parts and slightly damaged fixtures from major building companies. These stores are often local businesses, so a quick Google search should bring up the appropriate place to go depending on your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiny living can be either inexpensive or about the cost of a small starter home. Try finding a $100,000 home with truly top-of-the-line fittings.&lt;/p&gt;

The Cost of Living in a Tiny Home
&lt;p&gt;Living in a tiny home can be incredibly affordable. Heating, cooling, and cleaning 300 square feet is a whole lot cheaper and easier than doing so for a 2,322-square-foot home (the median new home size in 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can reduce your water, power, and other bills even further if you choose to live a sustainability focused lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar panels, well water, and options such as a wood stove for heating can drop your living expenses substantially and shrink your carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other expenses to consider, though, especially if you’re living in a tiny house on wheels and plan to travel. Gas, insurance, and campground fees can add up fast.&lt;/p&gt;
Finding a Place to Live
&lt;p&gt;One thing that you have to take into account when considering the cost and value of tiny living is where you live. Most American cities aren’t tiny-home friendly. Many zoning laws prohibit full-time tiny-home habitation across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you plan to stay in one place, you have to find land that allows tiny homes and has the necessary improvements with water, sewage, and electrical hookups. Many tiny-home dwellers get around this by living on family land or going out into a more rural area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re more sustainably minded, a tiny home is one of the best ways to explore alternative lifestyles. This allows you to disconnect from traditional ways of Western life and see what living off the grid can be like.&lt;/p&gt;
The Resale Market
&lt;p&gt;If you just go by all the reality shows and hype you’d think the tiny home market was absolutely booming. The reality is, well, a tiny bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiny homes are popular, in a big way. But that doesn’t mean that everyone, or even most people, are willing to live in one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask any real estate agent about home renovations, and they’ll advise you to go for broader appeal. Look for the improvements that match the largest portion of the market’s taste and try not to over customize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 56 percent of Americans would consider living in a tiny home, according to a survey by IPX 1031, a Fidelity National financial company. Anything that has such a limited market — or liquidity — is going to be harder to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
Taking Out a Loan
&lt;p&gt;The biggest selling point for tiny homes is that you don’t need to take out a mortgage, according to Hannah Maman, a real estate agent in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won’t find a traditional home loan for a tiny house because most mortgage lenders have minimum loan amounts that are much higher than the one needed for a tiny house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, typical mortgage lenders won’t give out a loan because many tiny houses are on wheels/transportable and not on a foundation, and most lenders require a permanent foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, Maman explains that you can finance directly through a builder or take out either a personal loan or an RV loan. If you are to take out an RV loan for a tiny house, it must first be certified under the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association (to show it’s safe for the road). You can expect to get about 4 to 9 percent interest rates here on a term of 70 to 85 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you aren’t association certified and would rather take out a personal loan, this is doable. It would just be an unsecured personal loan with a higher interest rate, in the 7 to 11 percent range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So many individuals are struggling with debt and are looking for viable alternatives to being locked into a 30-year mortgage,” Maman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even maintenance and utility bills are cut in half, which saves people a ton of money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Maman states, “I think people need to be aware that buying a tiny home, in most cases, isn’t the same as buying a traditional home.” Continue reading below to find out why this kind of investment may not be for you.&lt;/p&gt;

Do Tiny Homes Appreciate in Value?
&lt;p&gt;Best answer: It’s complicated. Traditional wisdom tells us owning a house over a long period of time — say at least five years — can be a good way to grow your money. After all, don’t homes grow in value over time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land that your home sits on may appreciate in value, but the physical house is actually depreciating. The same thing holds true for tiny homes, with the added twist that you don’t usually own any land under them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t expect your tiny home to appreciate in value like a traditional home, advises Noaz Miller, a home-insurance specialist in Scottsdale, Arizona. Location is the key factor that predicts valuation, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Land typically appreciates or depreciates with the local market,” Miller says. Any traditional home with a permanent foundation will have better resale value than a tiny home on wheels, which will depreciate in value like an RV.&lt;/p&gt;
Tiny Homes as Passive Income Investments
&lt;p&gt;If you’re renting out a tiny home, it could be a source of passive income, as is any other rental property. But be aware that there are a host of considerations to consider before becoming a landlord, such as state and local laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A landlord should use a legally reviewed template for their state when creating a lease. States vary in terms of their protections for tenants and landlords, so ensure you protect yourself as much as possible in the event that any tenant falls far enough behind on rent that legal intervention is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One should also take into careful consideration the financial aspects of maintaining the property. Last, be sure to screen your tenants. As problems arise, you will likely be the one responsible for fixing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The Downsides of Tiny Homes
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in living in a tiny home, take care to consider the effects that the size of tiny homes can have on your life. Sure, it would be awesome to travel the world in a tiny home on wheels, but the little rational voice might start screaming, “No! You don’t have a remote job, so you can’t just pick up and go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also may need more than 500 square feet of space. If you ever intend to host friends and have family stay with you, you need more than one bedroom and bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention the difficult regulations that you would have to abide by if you built your own tiny home. Most tiny homes have wheels to avoid the zoning laws in the city, leaving owners scrambling to find a place to park it legally. Some might be able to put it in the backyard of a regular home, but the area must have the proper zoning to accommodate full-time camping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the tiny house has a foundation and isn’t on wheels, it would have to comply with building codes, which usually means it must be a minimum of 700 square feet. For that reason, many people turn to rural areas where land is less expensive to build and park their tiny homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you’re a city person, it may not be practical for you to live out in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
The Bottom Line
&lt;p&gt;A tiny home can be a great investment for the right person. If you want to build your own house, travel the country with it, and embrace an alternative lifestyle, a tiny home can be an affordable way to accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can customize the home almost endlessly and save money on rent and utilities. It also allows you to take the comforts of home to all kinds of wild and beautiful places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to go tiny with an eye toward reselling your home down the line and realizing gains, you may be disappointed. Tiny homes depreciate and can be difficult to sell, so they might not make good investments in that sense. And if you want to live in a major city, it can be difficult and expensive to find somewhere to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>If you’re savvy and willing to spend some time researching, you can often find reclaimed materials or leftovers from a job site.</p>
<p>There are entire stores that sell nothing but the extra parts and slightly damaged fixtures from major building companies. These stores are often local businesses, so a quick Google search should bring up the appropriate place to go depending on your location.</p>
<p>Tiny living can be either inexpensive or about the cost of a small starter home. Try finding a $100,000 home with truly top-of-the-line fittings.</p>

The Cost of Living in a Tiny Home
<p>Living in a tiny home can be incredibly affordable. Heating, cooling, and cleaning 300 square feet is a whole lot cheaper and easier than doing so for a 2,322-square-foot home (the median new home size in 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau).</p>
<p>You can reduce your water, power, and other bills even further if you choose to live a sustainability focused lifestyle.</p>
<p>Solar panels, well water, and options such as a wood stove for heating can drop your living expenses substantially and shrink your carbon footprint.</p>
<p>There are other expenses to consider, though, especially if you’re living in a tiny house on wheels and plan to travel. Gas, insurance, and campground fees can add up fast.</p>
Finding a Place to Live
<p>One thing that you have to take into account when considering the cost and value of tiny living is where you live. Most American cities aren’t tiny-home friendly. Many zoning laws prohibit full-time tiny-home habitation across the board.</p>
<p>Even if you plan to stay in one place, you have to find land that allows tiny homes and has the necessary improvements with water, sewage, and electrical hookups. Many tiny-home dwellers get around this by living on family land or going out into a more rural area.</p>
<p>If you’re more sustainably minded, a tiny home is one of the best ways to explore alternative lifestyles. This allows you to disconnect from traditional ways of Western life and see what living off the grid can be like.</p>
The Resale Market
<p>If you just go by all the reality shows and hype you’d think the tiny home market was absolutely booming. The reality is, well, a tiny bit different.</p>
<p>Tiny homes are popular, in a big way. But that doesn’t mean that everyone, or even most people, are willing to live in one.</p>
<p>Ask any real estate agent about home renovations, and they’ll advise you to go for broader appeal. Look for the improvements that match the largest portion of the market’s taste and try not to over customize.</p>
<p></p>
<p>About 56 percent of Americans would consider living in a tiny home, according to a survey by IPX 1031, a Fidelity National financial company. Anything that has such a limited market — or liquidity — is going to be harder to sell.</p>
Taking Out a Loan
<p>The biggest selling point for tiny homes is that you don’t need to take out a mortgage, according to Hannah Maman, a real estate agent in Phoenix.</p>
<p>You won’t find a traditional home loan for a tiny house because most mortgage lenders have minimum loan amounts that are much higher than the one needed for a tiny house.</p>
<p>Additionally, typical mortgage lenders won’t give out a loan because many tiny houses are on wheels/transportable and not on a foundation, and most lenders require a permanent foundation.</p>
<p>That said, Maman explains that you can finance directly through a builder or take out either a personal loan or an RV loan. If you are to take out an RV loan for a tiny house, it must first be certified under the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association (to show it’s safe for the road). You can expect to get about 4 to 9 percent interest rates here on a term of 70 to 85 months.</p>
<p>However, if you aren’t association certified and would rather take out a personal loan, this is doable. It would just be an unsecured personal loan with a higher interest rate, in the 7 to 11 percent range.</p>
<p>“So many individuals are struggling with debt and are looking for viable alternatives to being locked into a 30-year mortgage,” Maman says.</p>
<p>“Even maintenance and utility bills are cut in half, which saves people a ton of money.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, Maman states, “I think people need to be aware that buying a tiny home, in most cases, isn’t the same as buying a traditional home.” Continue reading below to find out why this kind of investment may not be for you.</p>

Do Tiny Homes Appreciate in Value?
<p>Best answer: It’s complicated. Traditional wisdom tells us owning a house over a long period of time — say at least five years — can be a good way to grow your money. After all, don’t homes grow in value over time?</p>
<p>Not always.</p>
<p>The land that your home sits on may appreciate in value, but the physical house is actually depreciating. The same thing holds true for tiny homes, with the added twist that you don’t usually own any land under them.</p>
<p>Don’t expect your tiny home to appreciate in value like a traditional home, advises Noaz Miller, a home-insurance specialist in Scottsdale, Arizona. Location is the key factor that predicts valuation, he adds.</p>
<p>“Land typically appreciates or depreciates with the local market,” Miller says. Any traditional home with a permanent foundation will have better resale value than a tiny home on wheels, which will depreciate in value like an RV.</p>
Tiny Homes as Passive Income Investments
<p>If you’re renting out a tiny home, it could be a source of passive income, as is any other rental property. But be aware that there are a host of considerations to consider before becoming a landlord, such as state and local laws.</p>
<p>A landlord should use a legally reviewed template for their state when creating a lease. States vary in terms of their protections for tenants and landlords, so ensure you protect yourself as much as possible in the event that any tenant falls far enough behind on rent that legal intervention is needed.</p>
<p>One should also take into careful consideration the financial aspects of maintaining the property. Last, be sure to screen your tenants. As problems arise, you will likely be the one responsible for fixing them.</p>
<p></p>
The Downsides of Tiny Homes
<p>If you’re interested in living in a tiny home, take care to consider the effects that the size of tiny homes can have on your life. Sure, it would be awesome to travel the world in a tiny home on wheels, but the little rational voice might start screaming, “No! You don’t have a remote job, so you can’t just pick up and go.”</p>
<p>You also may need more than 500 square feet of space. If you ever intend to host friends and have family stay with you, you need more than one bedroom and bathroom.</p>
<p>Not to mention the difficult regulations that you would have to abide by if you built your own tiny home. Most tiny homes have wheels to avoid the zoning laws in the city, leaving owners scrambling to find a place to park it legally. Some might be able to put it in the backyard of a regular home, but the area must have the proper zoning to accommodate full-time camping.</p>
<p>If the tiny house has a foundation and isn’t on wheels, it would have to comply with building codes, which usually means it must be a minimum of 700 square feet. For that reason, many people turn to rural areas where land is less expensive to build and park their tiny homes.</p>
<p>But if you’re a city person, it may not be practical for you to live out in the woods.</p>
The Bottom Line
<p>A tiny home can be a great investment for the right person. If you want to build your own house, travel the country with it, and embrace an alternative lifestyle, a tiny home can be an affordable way to accomplish this.</p>
<p>You can customize the home almost endlessly and save money on rent and utilities. It also allows you to take the comforts of home to all kinds of wild and beautiful places.</p>
<p>If you want to go tiny with an eye toward reselling your home down the line and realizing gains, you may be disappointed. Tiny homes depreciate and can be difficult to sell, so they might not make good investments in that sense. And if you want to live in a major city, it can be difficult and expensive to find somewhere to do so.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to save money on groceries, I decided to do away with them altogether. Am I joking? Technically, no. I did stop eating and stop buying groceries. How? The Soylent diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is a meal replacement beverage. It was created by a computer scientist, not a chef, and it’s engineered to give your body everything you need to function well. This means somebody can live entirely off this drink alone, and — in theory — should still lead a perfectly normal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing your lifestyle to this extent isn’t as abnormal as you may think. In the United States, the meal replacement market is worth a shocking $4.1 billion, according to IBISWorld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Time Is Money
&lt;p&gt;The Soylent diet caught my attention for many reasons. The first actually wasn’t about money — it was about time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think I’m being stingy with my time, but I’m young. Think of all the time I would save by not having to cook. That would effectively add months to my life! I also wouldn’t have to grocery shop very often (never, really). Soylent can be delivered to my door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason I found it so appealing was for health reasons. Stay with me, because I’m about to get pretty holistic about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love automation. Automation means you can set something good in motion and have it run without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can do awesome things without constant motivation. Think automatic bill pay or 401(k) contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Soylent, I’m constantly having to make healthy eating decisions. I eat at least three meals per day. That means I’m having to consciously make healthy choices three-plus times per day, so I sometimes don’t eat as healthy as I should. With Soylent, I can be healthy without having to worry about the ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I wouldn’t replace all my meals with Soylent. But many of my boring meals would get replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
Vacation Meals on a Budget
&lt;p&gt;The final reason Soylent caught my eye is the cost. Prices vary based on the amount and whether it’s in bottled or powder form for you to mix, but it’s around $3 per bottle, or $3 per meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though that’s more expensive than most home-cooked meals, it saves a lot of money when traveling or just being out and about. Instead of needing to buy a meal, you can just pull a bottle out of your backpack or purse, and crack it open.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris: “Purple Carrot delivers a box with three vegan meals to prepare a week. The best part is that it comes with a little cookbook each time. I just buy the ingredients later on if I want to make a recipe again. It got me out of a rut of making me the same stuff…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuart: “I make my own chicken broth from store-bought rotisserie chickens. I hate using fresh onion, carrot or celery just for broth. I developed the habit of taking scraps of the three when I cook and storing them in a container in the freezer. When I need to make broth, I just dump it into my instant pot with my chicken. Saves time and money.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teresa: “Pay attention to how often your favorite products go on sale and stock up on enough to last you until the next cycle. There is a fairly predictable sales cycle.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrick: “Instant Pot. Two magic words.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tonia: “If you have the space, get a big box or upright extra freezer. Make massive batches of dishes like taco meat, slow-cooked pork, pot roast, Indian curry, rice dishes of any kind, etc. Batch them into containers so there’s no cooking during the week. We do this and order in once a week. We keep fresh broccoli, string beans and cauliflower in large Tupperware containers pre-cut and cleaned and quickly pan-fry or steam them in minutes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lisa: “Instacart. Restaurant Depot allows you to order from them to your home since the pandemic started. It’s basically Costco for restaurants.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arindam: “1-800-DIY.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kristen: “HelloFresh has saved me the headache of what to make and shopping for ingredients.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diane: “Make a big batch of pasta sauce or chili on Sunday, freeze some and eat some throughout the week.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
          
The Start of a New Diet
&lt;p&gt;I ordered my first round of Soylent a month ago straight from the website. The package arrived three days later. I opened the box and inside were a dozen white plastic bottles with black caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited to try one until the next day — I wanted to start with an empty stomach so I could get the full effect. That morning, I tried my first sip. It was oddly delicious. I was surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soylent is designed to have a neutral flavor so that the consumer doesn’t get sick of the taste. But still, it was slightly sweet. Soylent subtly smells and tastes of a graham cracker and looks like a light cappuccino.&lt;/p&gt;
An Epic Diet Fail
&lt;p&gt;About 20 minutes later, I felt like I had the flu. I ate some “real” food and the flu-like symptoms disappeared. I tried more Soylent the next day. Same reaction. I tried two more times — same reaction again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drank part of one right before doing 45 minutes of a cardio workout to check my energy levels. Exercising with the actual flu would’ve been easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Googled my symptoms. My reaction was very rare. It’s most likely the vanillin flavoring was to blame. And with that, my Soylent diet journey came to an abrupt end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my experience is negative, I still recommend you give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my mom, dad, and cousin to drink Soylent, and they all really enjoyed it. At least they can save time, enjoy better health, and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll continue my quest for a meal replacement beverage. So long, Soylent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Sullivan, director of communication at Soylent, says: “We know many people use our products to save both time and money and are able to do so successfully. However, we do not recommend anyone switching to a Soylent only diet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we always recommend everyone connect with their doctor or dietitian to decide the best overall meal plan to support your personal health goals and nutrition plan,” Sullivan adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentSai does not recommend changing your lifestyle or dietary habits without consulting your physician.&lt;/p&gt;
