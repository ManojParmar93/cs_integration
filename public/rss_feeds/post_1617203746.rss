&lt;?xml encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a revolution unfolding before our very eyes, and I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about geopolitics. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about currencies &amp;mdash; cryptocurrencies, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revolution, currently in its infancy, will eventually upend how governments, businesses, and consumers exchange money in our ever-present and expanding digital world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for the time being, most people really don&amp;rsquo;t understand cryptocurrencies, how they work, or how they can be so transformative. When people hear the term &amp;ldquo;cryptocurrency,&amp;rdquo; the most immediate reaction is usually to say that it&amp;rsquo;s either a highly speculative investment or just another way for drug dealers to use the power and dark parts of the internet to avoid law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just keep this in mind: Virtual currency is the future, paper is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So What Is Cryptocurrency, Anyway?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s all about mathematical theory melding with computer science. The most talked about cryptocurrencies of today &amp;mdash; like bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin &amp;mdash; are digital monies, or tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technology, which is decentralized and outside the authority of any governments, lets users make secure payments and store money without the need to go through a bank. In many cases, these transactions can be anonymous. Today, there are more than 3,300 cryptocurrencies available on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Cryptocurrency Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrencies run on blockchain technology. It's the heart and soul of this new virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The blockchain is essentially a secure, constantly updated ledger that records all transactions. It&amp;rsquo;s transparency on steroids.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how cryptocurrency works, think about video games &amp;mdash; a virtual world where you earn points that you can redeem for cool things like a weapon or vehicle. Well, in the cryptocurrency world, those rewards become tokens &amp;mdash; units of value that can buy &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; goods and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Players&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first cryptocurrency was bitcoin. It came out in 2009, invented by a mysterious individual in Japan named Satoshi Nakamoto, though many assume this moniker is a pseudonym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, bitcoin has a market capitalization over $110 billion and remains the most popular cryptocurrency on the market. In fact, many businesses around the world are willing to accept bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second most popular cryptocurrency is called Ethereum, a coin that allows users to create new businesses, products, and services through the exchange of ether tokens. (Ether is the actual name of the digital currency.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many in the artificial intelligence (AI) community are turning to ether tokens to help flesh out and develop AI innovations. In this brave new digital world, networks &amp;mdash; also called ecosystems &amp;mdash; are created that allow computer scientists, software developers, and other computer geeks to tag, model, process, and store data in exchange for ether tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those tokens can then be either converted into cash or spent on actual goods and services within the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Cryptocurrency Is a Game Changer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the promise of cryptocurrency is the simple fact that it is decentralized. Nobody &amp;mdash; no business, no government, no individual &amp;mdash; controls it. The people own it and can at least ensure its functionality and viability. &amp;ldquo;Screw the government and the big banks&amp;rdquo; is the new mantra. Can you think of anything more democratic in its mission?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="aff-cta"&gt;&lt;label&gt;Personal Finances Made Easy With This Saving and Investing App&lt;/label&gt; Sign Up For Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for many governments and Wall Street elites, a thriving new economy based not on U.S. dollars or euros, but on a digital currency that&amp;rsquo;s free of governmental control is pretty unsettling. Governments and banks want total control over every one of us. Bitcoin and ether represent a gigantic middle finger to the corrupt and inept government and banking elites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s so ironic that the secretive Chinese government has banned trading in cryptocurrencies since 2017, while JP Morgan Chase&amp;rsquo;s CEO Jamie Dimon denounced bitcoin as a fraud. (Though he has since backpedaled slightly.) Talk about calling the kettle black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Takeaway &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin, ether, and other cryptocurrencies are here to stay. They may even become a normal part of our everyday lives, just like Google, Facebook, and smartphones. Now&amp;rsquo;s the time to embrace the future!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;?xml encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-53141 alignright" src="https://centsai.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3-Reasons-You-Should-Embrace-Understanding-Taxes.png" alt="3 Reasons You Should Embrace Understanding Taxes. Understanding taxes doesn't have to be difficult or scary. In fact, it can even help you save money in the long run. Here's How. #taxes #taxestips #taxtips #taxinomy " width="338" height="579" srcset="https://centsai.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3-Reasons-You-Should-Embrace-Understanding-Taxes.png 338w, https://centsai.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3-Reasons-You-Should-Embrace-Understanding-Taxes.png 324w, https://centsai.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3-Reasons-You-Should-Embrace-Understanding-Taxes.png 735w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a typical wage earner or solopreneur, taxes aren&amp;rsquo;t particularly difficult. So why the dread and fear? Understanding taxes is a palatable alternative to fearing them outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The math isn&amp;rsquo;t complicated. Taxes rely mainly on addition and subtraction, and most software programs even remove that burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall chance of being audited by the IRS stands at less than 1 percent, so for most people, that falls into the not-in-my-lifetime category. Yet tax anxiety remains real and prevalent. Understanding taxes is one step in reducing your anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also help reduce your tax burden. A win-win for sure. Here are three important things to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Understanding Taxes Isn&amp;rsquo;t Difficult&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provided you&amp;rsquo;re not a financial professional or accountant, you probably don&amp;rsquo;t need to understand thousands of pages of laws, opinions, and case history. What you need to understand are the basics. For example, what is reportable income? What are deductible expenses? Why are they deductible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you understand why an expense is deductible, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a leg up. It helps you see what else you might also be able to deduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially for business owners and the self-employed, you begin to see how taxes are a factor in your decision-making process. You think about which expenses might be considered reasonable and necessary because you know how they are evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Understanding Taxes Helps You Avoid Mistakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself saying, &amp;ldquo;I should have known better&amp;rdquo;? Perhaps you didn&amp;rsquo;t say it in relation to taxes, but it can certainly apply to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people of good intent end up dealing with tax problems due to errors of ignorance. They weren&amp;rsquo;t trying to cheat, but they nevertheless committed a faux pas simply because they didn&amp;rsquo;t know what they were doing. Understanding taxes greatly reduces the likelihood of making mistakes of ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plus, having a good basic knowledge helps you not only avoid difficulties, but also avoid missing deductions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, did you know that taxpayers can deduct up to $2,500 in student loan interest? In some cases, that can mean significant savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Understanding Taxes Helps With Record Keeping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may seem intuitive, but if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you can and can&amp;rsquo;t claim on your taxes, then you won&amp;rsquo;t know which records you should keep. Sure, your CPA can do it for you, but only if you&amp;rsquo;re willing to pay a CPA&amp;rsquo;s rates to have your receipts organized and categorized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substantiating various incomes and expenses is fairly easy. But you need to know which records to keep and which not to bother with. If you understand the basics of your taxes, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to determine that &amp;mdash; as well as what other information you need, such as the business purpose of a deductible business lunch. (After all, it&amp;rsquo;s only a business lunch if it has a business purpose!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple things like that help you keep accurate records and not miss important information that could cost you in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="aff-cta"&gt;&lt;label&gt;Make Tax Filing and Account Management Stress-Free&lt;/label&gt; Start Your Free 30-Day Trial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you aren&amp;rsquo;t ready to really embrace understanding taxes. For many people, it&amp;rsquo;s a tough sell. But if you&amp;rsquo;re willing to work in that direction you will find that you&amp;rsquo;ll do a better job of making decisions based on after-tax results, do a better job of keeping records, and &amp;mdash; perhaps most important &amp;mdash; have less anxiety about taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;?xml encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Last September, I wrote a blog post with some &amp;ldquo;Barbservations&amp;rdquo; about &lt;/span&gt;entrepreneurship during a pandemic&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. In that post, I described five personal learning lessons: Be visible on social media, do some pro bono work, get a video-conferencing license, say &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to bad-fit assignments, and chart a new path.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;After decades working in academia, I have now been a full-time financial education entrepreneur for 15 months. Since I have had few role models for how to do this, I have built many bridges as I crossed them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I can count on one hand the number of colleagues I know who left longtime careers and continue to work actively in the same field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In an effort to help other aspiring third-age entrepreneurs, below are 10 additional learning lessons:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Show Up&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Fewer people think I am &amp;ldquo;retired&amp;rdquo; now than when I first left Rutgers University because I made very conscientious decisions to attend conferences, present webinars and podcasts, respond to media queries, &amp;ldquo;work out loud,&amp;rdquo; and share content via social media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I smiled recently when a colleague said &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re everywhere&amp;rdquo; because it indicated my strategy was working.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Branding, maintaining visibility, and professional development are ongoing processes for all successful entrepreneurs to attend to and are also great antidotes for older adult ageism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Identify Deliverable Stages and Invoice Accordingly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I did not do this with one large project that extended for six months. There were multiple levels of review that took much more time than either the client that hired me or I ever anticipated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now I set specific project milestones for clients with a first draft of content being the first deliverable that I invoice for.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This strategy evens out cash flow and makes income tax planning easier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Understand the Client&amp;rsquo;s Funder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Clients receive external funding to hire me for some of my work projects. Thus, it is key to understand their funder&amp;rsquo;s requirements and &amp;ldquo;hot buttons&amp;rdquo; (e.g. certain topics and/or website links to avoid). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Also, accept the fact that projects take longer when more entities are involved and that some funders hold back the money for your client to pay you with until they approve the final project results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Think Twice About Public Entities&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I am very wary now of doing any future work for state governments and public colleges. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Their hiring and payment &amp;ldquo;systems&amp;rdquo; are simply too onerous and time-consuming for this solo practitioner (e.g., proving my U.S. citizenship, filing an out-of-state business registration, completing elaborate online forms, and undergoing a background check that required unfreezing my credit, which I did not do). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;My advice: Ask plenty of process questions when someone from the public sector wants to hire you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Get Project Details in Writing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;On the other side of the spectrum are clients who do not have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; paperwork or hiring process at all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In this case, I provide a simple one-page memorandum of understanding (MOU) that includes a complete description of the deliverable, deliverable milestones (e.g., first draft, first round of revisions, final draft), the project timeline, and the amount that I am charging per hour and in total for the project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Stick to Your Niche&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;My niche is writing, speaking, and reviewing personal finance content. Period.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I said &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to requests to conduct research, write grants, and do a curriculum bias review, for which I was not qualified by training or life experience. I also passed on a speaking opportunity because I am not ready to travel by air yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. &amp;ldquo;Bookend&amp;rdquo; Your Day&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Much has been written over the past year about &amp;ldquo;blurred boundaries&amp;rdquo; with so many people working from home. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As a solo entrepreneur, it was quite a change for me from working with others at an office. I exercise before and after work hours to establish boundaries for when my workday starts and ends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Fill Work Spaces&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I have had almost no project down time since January 2020 because I have one ongoing client as an &amp;ldquo;anchor.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;With ad hoc projects, as soon as I finish one, I immediately start another in my queue to create space for new projects that may come along.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I fill small time gaps binge-writing posts like this one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Monitor Income Tax Payments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;With the exception of the &amp;ldquo;anchor&amp;rdquo; client, my first-year income as an entrepreneur was a big unknown at the start of 2020.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;By December, I had doubled revenue expectations. I used previous tax returns, the &lt;/span&gt;IRS tax withholding estimator&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; tool, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;the safe harbor rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; to avoid under-withholding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Create Synergies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Several client projects involve creating content for professionals who serve military families. I found that research and learning curves that informed one project also benefited another.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Similarly, I created a number of templates (e.g., for invoices, MOUs, and online quizzes) that can be used across multiple projects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As I wrote in &lt;/span&gt;my recent book, Flipping a Switch,&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; everyone needs some &amp;ldquo;big rocks&amp;rdquo; (e.g., work, volunteerism, caregiving, socialization) in their day to provide structure and a sense of purpose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Entrepreneurship is one of my &amp;ldquo;big rocks&amp;rdquo; and provides fulfillment, an outlet for creativity, and a good income. I hope that my insights are useful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

<?xml encoding="utf-8" ?><html><body><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last September, I wrote a blog post with some &ldquo;Barbservations&rdquo; about </span>entrepreneurship during a pandemic<span style="font-weight: 400;">. In that post, I described five personal learning lessons: Be visible on social media, do some pro bono work, get a video-conferencing license, say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to bad-fit assignments, and chart a new path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After decades working in academia, I have now been a full-time financial education entrepreneur for 15 months. Since I have had few role models for how to do this, I have built many bridges as I crossed them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can count on one hand the number of colleagues I know who left longtime careers and continue to work actively in the same field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to help other aspiring third-age entrepreneurs, below are 10 additional learning lessons:</span></p>
<h2><b>1. Show Up</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fewer people think I am &ldquo;retired&rdquo; now than when I first left Rutgers University because I made very conscientious decisions to attend conferences, present webinars and podcasts, respond to media queries, &ldquo;work out loud,&rdquo; and share content via social media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I smiled recently when a colleague said &ldquo;you&rsquo;re everywhere&rdquo; because it indicated my strategy was working.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branding, maintaining visibility, and professional development are ongoing processes for all successful entrepreneurs to attend to and are also great antidotes for older adult ageism.</span></p>
<h2><b></b><b>2. Identify Deliverable Stages and Invoice Accordingly</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did not do this with one large project that extended for six months. There were multiple levels of review that took much more time than either the client that hired me or I ever anticipated.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Now I set specific project milestones for clients with a first draft of content being the first deliverable that I invoice for.&nbsp;</b></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This strategy evens out cash flow and makes income tax planning easier.</span></p>
<h2><strong>3. Understand the Client&rsquo;s Funder</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clients receive external funding to hire me for some of my work projects. Thus, it is key to understand their funder&rsquo;s requirements and &ldquo;hot buttons&rdquo; (e.g. certain topics and/or website links to avoid). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, accept the fact that projects take longer when more entities are involved and that some funders hold back the money for your client to pay you with until they approve the final project results.</span></p>
<h2><b></b><b>4. Think Twice About Public Entities&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am very wary now of doing any future work for state governments and public colleges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their hiring and payment &ldquo;systems&rdquo; are simply too onerous and time-consuming for this solo practitioner (e.g., proving my U.S. citizenship, filing an out-of-state business registration, completing elaborate online forms, and undergoing a background check that required unfreezing my credit, which I did not do). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My advice: Ask plenty of process questions when someone from the public sector wants to hire you.</span></p>
<h2><b></b><b>5. Get Project Details in Writing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side of the spectrum are clients who do not have </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> paperwork or hiring process at all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this case, I provide a simple one-page memorandum of understanding (MOU) that includes a complete description of the deliverable, deliverable milestones (e.g., first draft, first round of revisions, final draft), the project timeline, and the amount that I am charging per hour and in total for the project.</span></p>
<h2><b></b><b>6. Stick to Your Niche</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My niche is writing, speaking, and reviewing personal finance content. Period.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to requests to conduct research, write grants, and do a curriculum bias review, for which I was not qualified by training or life experience. I also passed on a speaking opportunity because I am not ready to travel by air yet.</span></p>
<h2><b></b><b>7. &ldquo;Bookend&rdquo; Your Day</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much has been written over the past year about &ldquo;blurred boundaries&rdquo; with so many people working from home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a solo entrepreneur, it was quite a change for me from working with others at an office. I exercise before and after work hours to establish boundaries for when my workday starts and ends.</span></p>
<h2><b></b><b>8. Fill Work Spaces</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have had almost no project down time since January 2020 because I have one ongoing client as an &ldquo;anchor.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><b>With ad hoc projects, as soon as I finish one, I immediately start another in my queue to create space for new projects that may come along.&nbsp;</b></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I fill small time gaps binge-writing posts like this one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several client projects involve creating content for professionals who serve military families. I found that research and learning curves that informed one project also benefited another.&nbsp;</span></p>

&lt;?xml encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a time I vowed I would never live in Los Angeles. Ironically, that&amp;rsquo;s exactly where I ended up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I found myself uprooted from the leafy suburbs of Detroit and moving to L.A., embracing some of what Southern California had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L.A.&amp;rsquo;s cost of living is in stark contrast to Detroit&amp;rsquo;s. My dad owns a spacious two-bedroom home in the Detroit suburbs, and the cost of their mortgage is half of what I pay in rent for a no-frills, one-bedroom apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reason? A thing we like to call the &amp;ldquo;Paradise Tax.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I visit my folks, I have to drive 45 minutes to find the nearest Trader Joe&amp;rsquo;s. Planning a celebratory dinner? Your choice is limited to Chili&amp;rsquo;s, Red Lobster, Olive Garden, or Applebee&amp;rsquo;s. The part of Detroit where my parents live completely lacks any cultural activities whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison, living in Los Angeles can be great, provided you have a steady job or are making tons of money as a freelancer. It can be a downright drag if you&amp;rsquo;re living paycheck to paycheck, like I was after I was laid off from my steady, well-paying job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started freelancing, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;An unsteady income left me constantly stressed, keeping me away from the things that I wanted to do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When deciding where to live, one of the first factors to consider is your employment,&amp;rdquo; Zach A. Bachner, a certified financial planner with Summit Financial says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Once your needs are covered, create a budget. Every dollar you earn should be used to cover an expense or placed in a savings account. Creating a detailed budget is the best way to determine the standard of living you can afford,&amp;rdquo; Bachner continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compiling a budget can be tedious, but there are ways to challenge yourself and use your resources wisely. My situation forced me to be &amp;ldquo;creative,&amp;rdquo; and I soon found ways to get what I wanted out of life and the city for cheap or free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few ways that I hack my way through living in an expensive city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Save Money on Rent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though most people would advocate for getting a roommate or roommates, or moving to an area with a lower cost of living, I love where I live. And as someone in her 40s, I dread the thought of living with roommates again. But there are other, more creative ways to be frugal with your housing expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was call my landlord and ask to get my rent reduced. I was paying $1,450, at the time, plus utilities. Because I was a good, long-term tenant, he took $50 off my rent. He also took over the gas bill, which saved me almost $100 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of rent, my place comes with a detached garage. Since I&amp;rsquo;m a quasi-minimalist, I never had anything to store, and it was much easier for me to park my car on the street, anyway. So I decided to rent it out. I charged $170 at first, but eventually raised it to $250 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I should mention that you do run a huge risk doing this. My landlord doesn&amp;rsquo;t know that I&amp;rsquo;m doing this, and I could probably get in trouble. But for me, it was a risk worth taking &amp;mdash; and (knock on wood) it&amp;rsquo;s been smooth sailing for several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="aff-cta"&gt;&lt;label&gt;Get Homeowner&amp;rsquo;s Insurance From a Top Provider&lt;/label&gt; Find Out How!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to risk a long-term renter, try a short-term situation where you rent out your couch, air mattress, or spare room for a set amount of time to earn a little extra income, on Airbnb or VRBO. Just be careful to know who you are sharing your living space with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheap Gym Hacks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m one of those weirdos who loves to exercise, but I can&amp;rsquo;t justify paying for a gym. But there are frugal solutions here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through various connections, I got hooked up with an owner of a boutique gym, where I get unlimited classes in exchange for writing for the gym&amp;rsquo;s blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another time, I wanted to get into yoga, but again, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t justify paying even $10 for community classes. A friend tipped me off that many yoga studios offer classes in exchange for working a shift, and I landed a two-hour shift in exchange for unlimited classes. In fact, part of that two hours was actually taking the yoga class!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save on Socializing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My social life almost disappeared when I became frugal. I had to get creative if I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to become a hermit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told various friends that if they ever needed extra help with their business, they should give me a call. They did, and I began to help out at networking events, corporate team-building events, and city-league sports. Not only did I get a chance to be social, I was also getting paid &amp;mdash; and many of the gigs offered free food and drinks, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a drag, even if you live in an expensive city like Los Angeles and are struggling financially. You just need to get creative. Think about what you really want out of life and find ways to get it for cheap &amp;mdash; or even for free &amp;mdash; by thinking outside of the box. You&amp;rsquo;d be surprised at how easy it is to frugal hack your way through life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Name has been changed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;?xml encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total cost of Cassandra&amp;rsquo;s mother&amp;rsquo;s heart bypass surgery after her second heart attack was $104,398.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, rising health care costs mean that Americans spend over $3.8 trillion per year on medical expenses, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. For many Americans, this can mean lifelong expenses that can burden generations of family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her mother&amp;rsquo;s first surgery had already resulted in Cassandra* losing her job as a secretary for a real estate company. After the second operation, with no job, no insurance, no spouse, and nowhere to turn, Cassandra&amp;rsquo;s mother asked her daughter, a recent grad working as a marketing analyst, for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Cassandra didn&amp;rsquo;t have that kind of money. She couldn&amp;rsquo;t even afford to pay her student loans or to live in her own apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Cassandra wanted to help. Her mom had raised her without any financial support and had struggled to ensure that she could pursue her dream of getting into one of the top universities in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She couldn&amp;rsquo;t sit idly by while bill collectors hounded her mother during such a critical time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What kind of daughter would I be?&amp;rdquo; Cassandra says. &amp;ldquo;What kind of human would I be? I had to do something. If she knew what I had to do to pay off those bills, I think she would never forgive me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Cassandra, paying down $104,000 meant restarting her life by beginning her own business as a prostitute &amp;mdash; a job that could have landed her in prison &amp;mdash; or gotten her killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Other Way to Pay the Bills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassandra shared her worries with a few friends. One mentioned knowing someone who worked as an escort in New York, who claimed that she made around $40,000 in three months. Cassandra reached out, and the escort explained how they ran their business, how to find clients, and how to handle security and health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassandra tentatively began developing the business end. She bought a website domain and paid for web hosting. Then she uploaded tasteful pictures of herself, along with a bio describing how she enjoyed art museums, trips overseas, and shopping at Tiffany&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It all felt normal,&amp;rdquo; she recalls. &amp;ldquo;It was like putting up an online dating profile.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later, her life as a prostitute had begun. She got her first call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was a thrill,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;I emailed him a copy of a contract I found online, and then I had him PayPal me a $1,000 deposit. He sent everything back within minutes, including an additional $500 for an extra hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;That night, we went to one of the top restaurants in NYC and saw a Broadway show. It was so exciting! I felt like a princess &amp;mdash; until we got back to the hotel and the real &amp;lsquo;job&amp;rsquo; began.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she went home to her mother&amp;rsquo;s place, she counted her money: a total of $6,500 for six hours. Cassandra called a collector and paid off the first chunk of what was owed to the hospital&amp;rsquo;s collection services, and then she went out and filled her mother&amp;rsquo;s pantry with healthy foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Making that payment was the only thing I could do to keep myself from running out of my skin,&amp;rdquo; she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t sleep well for months after that. But I constantly reminded myself that it was temporary, a means to an end for both my mother and me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div class="chck-lst-head"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other Ways to Repay Medical Debt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="chck-lst-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, turning to prostitution is not the only way to relieve your debt. There are many ways to satisfy collections agencies without having to use methods you may not want to pursue. Here are some tips from a bankruptcy and debt relief attorney at the Luftman, Heck, and Associates LLP, Matthew Alden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pursue the Debt Settlement Option: &lt;/strong&gt;By having a lawyer negotiate a lower balance with a medical provider, you can avoid having to pay the full balance, which can save you tens of thousands, if not more, in the long run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hire a Debt Relief Lawyer:&lt;/strong&gt; If you&amp;rsquo;re injured and unable to pay the medical debt, hire a debt relief lawyer to reach an agreement with the medical provider called contingency medical payments. As a result, they cannot bill you or send the bill to collections, until you have received your settlement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File for &lt;/strong&gt;Chapter 13 Bankruptcy&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;This is not the most popular option, but it will help you eliminate extreme medical debt utilizing a three to five year repayment plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paying off the Debt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her first year in the life of a prostitute, Cassandra picked up six regular clients, which allowed her to pay off nearly $75,000 of her mom&amp;rsquo;s debt. Part of her income also went to keeping herself healthy and safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a close call one night with a potentially dangerous new client, she began running comprehensive background checks and hired a security guard to join her at the start and end of each date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also paid for weekly visits to the doctor and an independent health insurance plan for herself and her mother. All of those business expenses accounted for nearly $25,000 annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I really loved the idea that I was running my own business,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;I started to learn things I never knew how to do in college, like accounting and payroll&amp;hellip;But I still wanted nothing more than to close it down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cassandra&amp;rsquo;s mom, who took about nine months to fully recover, never really questioned what was happening to the bills.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the phone calls stopped coming, Cassandra told her mother that she had decided to go back to school and use the student loans to pay the monthly payments. She also disguised her life as a prostitute as part of a new job at a startup marketing company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Cassandra confided in her regular clients about the situation &amp;mdash; and was surprised at their reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They stopped buying me designer clothes,&amp;rdquo; she recalls, &amp;ldquo;and instead gave me gift cards to grocery stores and gas stations, so I could get my mom to a doctor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of her clients even offered to pay off all the debt in exchange for a weeklong overseas trip. She accepted, and after nearly 20 months, Cassandra&amp;rsquo;s call girl service ended with one trip to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Worth of Selling Yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year after she stopped her business, Cassandra enrolled in an MBA program where she studied nonprofits and found a job as a marketing analyst for a major nonprofit. Her mother made a full recovery and now lives with Cassandra and her new husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassandra says she has many regrets. &amp;ldquo;Every day was a regret,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t like what I did, even if it was for the right reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now, I wish I had taken over the debt sooner, gotten a payment plan set up, or maybe even worked with a financial advisor on how I could have solved this without becoming a call girl. I was young and stupid. But it worked out in the end, and I can&amp;rsquo;t pretend like my life wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be this great or debt-free if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done what I did.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
